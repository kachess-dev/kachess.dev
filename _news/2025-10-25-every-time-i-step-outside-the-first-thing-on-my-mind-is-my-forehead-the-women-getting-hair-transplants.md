However, the procedure's high cost and prevalence of botched jobs raise safety concerns. Aria, 27, began losing her hair after contracting COVID-19 in 2021 and is now set to undergo a £5,500 hair transplant procedure at a Portsmouth clinic. She represents a growing demographic of women turning to hair transplant surgeries for a solution to hair loss and the accompanying self-consciousness.
