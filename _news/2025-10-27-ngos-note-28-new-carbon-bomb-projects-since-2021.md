NGOs have identified 28 new "carbon bomb" projects since 2021, with potential CO2 emissions from these projects being 11 times the global "carbon budget" that remains to achieve the targets set by the Paris Agreement. These projects, spread across 16 countries, pose a significant threat to global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Urgent action is required to prevent these projects from going ahead and to ensure that the targets of the Paris Agreement are met.
