  With Balenciaga’s new range embracing a term that the fashion industry once shied away from, the era of quiet luxury may finally be over

Balenciaga's new range is embracing the term 'luxury', signaling a shift in the fashion industry's attitude towards overt displays of opulence. Examples of luxury are being redefined, ranging from a £8m Birkin bag to a £1,590 cotton hoodie by Balenciaga, featuring a faux fur-trimmed hood and the brand's name. Worn by Gwyneth Paltrow in British Vogue, the hoodie is seen as a humorous take on the concept of luxury. This shift suggests the era of quiet luxury may be coming to an end, replaced by more conspicuous consumption and open expressions of wealth.
