The King County Prosecutor's Office in Washington has implemented a new policy to accelerate case-filing decisions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the average time for these decisions was approximately 100 days. Under the new policy, these decisions will now have to be made within 30 days. This change aims to expedite the legal process and reduce backlog.
