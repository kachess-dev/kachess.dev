  a rich man's world. <em>The Seattle Times</em> has <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/mariners-baseball-seattle-politics-cross-paths-as-money-starts-to-flow/\">the
  sorry story</a>.</p>\n            <p><strong>Busting That Does Not Make Us Feel
  Good:</strong> This incident happened on Sunday, while the musician's band, <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/federal-agents-barrel-into-band-at-portland-ice-protest-arrest-clarinetist-accuse-her-of-assault/\">Unpresidented
  Brass Band</a>, played the <em>Ghostbusters</em> theme across the street from the
  city's notorious ICE building. The clarinetist, \"a 38-year-old child and family
  therapist,\" is being held without formal charges. \"Ain't that [Trump's] America.\"
  The musicians in the therapist's band wore banana costumes. </p>\n<img alt=\"\"

  width=\"600\" />\n\U0001F3B5 With their bikes, and their bars, and their lattes,
  and their frogs \U0001F3B5\n\n<p><strong>The pic above was taken on Saturday (October
  12) in a war zone called Downtown Portland.</strong> One could walk, in a matter
  minutes, from here to where the clarinetist in a banana costume was arrested. And
  what did I see on that fine rainy day? Portlanders doing Portlandish things—drinking
  coffee, drinking in dive bars, walking, biking. So, what's all this war zone nonsense
  really about? Trump is punishing a predominantly white city for demonstrating, at
  the beginning of this decade, the importance of Black lives. This was the original
  sin. This, and nothing else, fuels the obsession with Antifa. White people caring
  about Black people. Trump would not be in power if the majority of white people
  recognized the humanity of brown and Black people.</p>\n<p><strong>How do we explain
  the power of Portland's frog and other inflated creatures? </strong>I recommend
  watching this clip from Jean-Luc Godard's 1967 film <em>La Chinoise</em>.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Those
  familiar with the birth of cinema (1890 to 1910) will understand the young professor's
  meaning. Film historians usually present Lumière brothers work as real (snapshots
  of everyday life) and those of filmmaker/magician Georges Méliès, as fictional.
  After all, the clips produced by the former were called \"actualities;\" and the
  short films by the latter were clearly fantasies. But the professor in Godard's
  film insists that the opposite is true in the context of cinema. The shots of everyday
  life by the Lumière brothers are fantastic; and those by Méliès, such as <em>Le
  Voyage dans la Lune</em>, are the actualities. This, in my view, is what's going
  on in Portland. Trump's administration claims that it is the real, the actuality,
  but it is in fact the fantasy. And Portland's inflated creatures are real because
  they reveal that the real is actually a fantasy. </p>\n<p><strong>This is why you
  must always live in a city.  </strong>What does Everett do after the Fred Meyer
  closures? Offer, for the next 6 months, a free transit route that has access to
  locations <a href=\"https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/everett-offering-free-transit-6-months-grocery-stores-following-fred-meyers-closure/KK7AKZ2AIZC5LPC4L3NAQAB3VY/\">with
  grocery stores</a>. Of course, all bus routes should be free all of the time. But
  a city also needs to find ways to be less dependent on corporate supermarkets and
  drugstores. We are not like the rural areas, which don't have the efficiency of
  density on their side. When a giant goes in a city, it has the means to easily fill
  the hole with smaller and local businesses. Indeed, exactly this is happening right
  now in <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/walmart-close-federal-way-local-small-grocery-stores-success/281-cb2eda4a-804b-4895-afb3-19ea5ade3466\">Federal
  Way</a>: \"As Walmart prepares to close in Federal Way, local small grocery stores
  are finding success.\" That city, by the way, will soon (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Way_Link_Extension\">December
  6</a>) be connected to Link's Line 1. </p>\n<p><strong>Yes, it's nice and (almost)
  cold</strong>. But the sun refuses to be done with us. What gives? We need the rain
  to resume, which, unfortunately, will not happen today, which will be much like
  yesterday—sunny but, thankfully, sweater weather. The clouds are expected to gather
  tomorrow and gradually grow as <a href=\"https://www.kiro7.com/weather/\">the week
  progresses</a>.  </p>\n<p><strong>Let's get this right.</strong> In 2023, Argentina
  voted for a libertarian, Javier Milei, because he promised that, if unleashed from
  the government, the creative and wealth-generating powers of the market would explode.
  Two years later, nothing of the kind happened. In fact, Milei received government
  cheese from Trump to keep his free market dream alive. And it gets worse. <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c0mxnp3kr90t\">The
  BBC</a>: \"Trump says upcoming Argentina elections will decide how 'generous' US
  will be.\" Meaning, if Milei loses power, the US is \"<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-14/trump-says-he-ll-discuss-trade-deal-with-milei-defends-lifeline?embedded-checkout=true\">gone</a>.\"
  Meaning, the US is only offering socialism for free markets and not for the poor
  or working classes. Trump: “I’m with this man because his philosophy is correct.
  And he may win and he may not win – I think he’s going to win. And if he wins we
  are staying with him, and if he doesn’t win we are gone.” Need one say more.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>new

The Stranger's morning news roundup. by Charles Mudede

**KOMO!** Say [it ain't so](https://komonews.com/sports/nikos-sports-zone/gallery/mariners-super-power-is-staying-the-course-no-matter-what?photo=1). We already hate your conservative owners, but you should never, ever write headlines like this: "Mariners' super power is staying the course no matter what." Were you born yesterday? Are you new to the city? Have you not heard of the infamous "Seattle choke"? Many of us recall Dikembe Mutombo grabbing that ball from the Sonics' greatest season.

We should keep our traps shut, proceed one step at a time, and be happy that we have three guaranteed playoff games in Seattle that will force a hoard of Canadians in Vancouver to cross the border and blow a bunch of cash on our city. That is our bird in the hand.

**By the way** , the big and bad money behind Mayor Bruce Harrell bought ads that will attack his opponent, Katie Wilson, during Monday's semifinals match between the Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays. The ads will say all sorts of nasty things about a perfectly good person. Money. Money. Money. Such is a rich man's world. _The Seattle Times_ has [the sorry story](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/mariners-baseball-seattle-politics-cross-paths-as-money-starts-to-flow/).

**Busting That Does Not Make Us Feel Good:** This incident happened on Sunday, while the musician's band, [Unpresidented Brass Band](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/federal-agents-barrel-into-band-at-portland-ice-protest-arrest-clarinetist-accuse-her-of-assault/), played the _Ghostbusters_ theme across the street from the city's notorious ICE building.
