The article discusses the issue of rubber plants losing leaves and developing tiny black dots. The problem is identified as a thrips infestation. Thrips are small insects that puncture leaf surfaces to drain sap, causing the leaves to show silvery streaks, mottling, curling, and eventually dropping off. These pests thrive in warm, dry conditions and can spread rapidly, especially on mature, leafy plants. Their damage is often incorrectly attributed to nutrient deficiencies or sun scorch, but the distinguishing sign is the combination of silvery streaks with tiny black specks.
