  According to an email invitation obtained by <em>The Stranger</em>, the event started

  Harrell was scheduled to address the group “regarding accomplishments, progress
  made, needs, policy priorities, and the campaign.” At 6 p.m., “PAC leader” Tim Burgess,

  a candidate” should be considered a contribution to that candidate. Any expenditure
  made with “fundraising-assistance” from someone from the campaign—like, perhaps,
  speaking at the fundraising event—should be considered an expenditure for the campaign.</p>\n<p><em>The
  Stranger</em> shared the event invitation details with election experts and political
  consultants familiar with Washington’s election law. The law is complicated and
  nuanced, they all said, but this event creates the appearance of coordination between
  the campaign and the PAC. If they did coordinate, the PAC’s big-dollar spending
  on attack ads this month could be a violation of <a href=\"https://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=390-05-210\">campaign
  finance law</a>, or more specifically, the Washington Administrative Code. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When
  reached for comment, Harrell’s campaign did not answer detailed questions regarding
  this event and the efforts the campaign might have made to avoid coordinating with
  the PAC. “Neither Mayor Harrell nor our campaign coordinates with IE groups, and
  we ensure that we are in compliance with all PDC rules,” was the only response. </p>\n<p>Neither
  the PAC nor Deputy Mayor Burgess responded to <em>The Stranger</em>’s requests for
  comment.</p>\n<p>The event’s invitation came from organizers of the People for Seattle
  PAC, which backed Chamber of Commerce candidates and papered mailboxes with negative
  ads about the progressive city council in 2019. Burgess, Harrell’s deputy mayor, <a

  that PFS  “contributed significantly to voters eventually changing the make-up of

  Seattle City Council President Sara Nelson, the email cited, experienced bad primary
  showing “in large part due to the stresses our voters are feeling that have been
  put on ‘Blue States’ by the current federal administration…non-centrist, unprepared,
  and inexperienced voices grew support for candidates… that do not align with the

  are subject to campaign finance laws that limit the total amount of money they can

  $84,130 they spent on ads that will air from this week until the day before the
  election. To keep their “independent” status, though, these PACs can’t coordinate

  around campaign finance laws.</p>\n<p>Political consultant Crystal Fincher tells
  <em>The Stranger </em>that an event like the one Harrell spoke at blurs the lines

State Election Authority Calls It “Unusual,” Says It Introduces Questions About Campaign Financing
 by Nathalie Graham 

On Sept. 16, Bruce Harrell was scheduled to attend a fundraising event for Bruce Harrell for Seattle’s Future, the political action committee supporting his reelection campaign. According to an email invitation obtained by&nbsp;_The Stranger_, the event started at 5 p.m. at a downtown office building. There were refreshments. At 5:15 p.m., Harrell was scheduled to address the group “regarding accomplishments, progress made, needs, policy priorities, and the campaign.” At 6 p.m., “PAC leader” Tim Burgess, who works under Harrell as deputy mayor, addressed “the current imperatives, leads discussion” and then did a Q&A with the attendees.

According to Kim Bradshaw, deputy director at the Public Disclosure Commission, Harrell speaking at a fundraising event for his PAC is “unusual.”

“[It] does invite questions regarding whether the event was an in-kind contribution to the candidate and/or the PAC,” Bradshaw wrote in an email.

The PAC, which has raised $1.5 million to support Harrell’s campaign, is allowed to fundraise far beyond what Harrell’s campaign can. A PAC can accept a donation of any size, while Harrell, who is participating in the democracy voucher program, can only accept $650 per donor.

According to Washington State Law, they absolutely cannot coordinate. The Washington Administrative Code states that any money spent in "cooperation, consultation, concern, or collaboration with, or at the request or suggestion of a candidate” should be considered a contribution to that candidate. Any expenditure made with “fundraising-assistance” from someone from the campaign—like, perhaps, speaking at the fundraising event—should be considered an expenditure for the campaign.

_The Stranger_ shared the event invitation details with election experts and political consultants familiar with Washington’s election law. The law is complicated and nuanced, they all said, but this event creates the appearance of coordination between the campaign and the PAC. If they did coordinate, the PAC’s big-dollar spending on attack ads this month could be a violation of [campaign finance law](https://app.leg.wa.gov/WAC/default.aspx?cite=390-05-210), or more specifically, the Washington Administrative Code.&nbsp;
