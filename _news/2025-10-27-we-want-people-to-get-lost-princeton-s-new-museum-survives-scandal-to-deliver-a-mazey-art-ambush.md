  It is architect David Adjaye’s first major project since the allegations that rocked his firm – a bold museum for Princeton University with exhibits that sneak up on its students. But do the insides match the outsides?

  A cluster of serrated concrete bunkers has landed in the heart of Princeton University’s leafy campus in New Jersey, sending tremors through this twee [Oxbridge fantasyland of gothic turrets and twiddly spires](https://jerseydigs.com/princeton-university-architecture/).

The museum, resembling a cluster of serrated concrete bunkers, contrasts starkly with the university's gothic architecture. Despite its austere exterior, it serves as a fitting repository for the university's impressive 117,000-piece art and antiquities collection. The collection, previously scattered across various extensions, now has a dedicated space in this purpose-built structure.
