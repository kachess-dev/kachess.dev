Organised criminal groups in the UK are reportedly making millions annually from the illegal dumping and burning of waste, due to a lack of enforcement and a 'low-risk, high-reward' culture. A Lords committee informed the government that criminality is rampant in the waste sector, with an estimated 38 million tonnes of waste being illegally managed each year.
