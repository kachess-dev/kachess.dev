  \         \n          \n          \n            <p>When was the last time you ate
  a banana split? I asked myself this question and drew a blank. I remember loving
  the indulgent triple-scoop sundae, and I was certain that I’d had one, but with
  no specific memory of when or why. Was this a false memory, shaped by a childhood
  full of banana split scratch-and-sniff stickers and images of wide-eyed children
  in books ogling them through shop windows?</p>\n<p>It’d make sense. My love for
  the banana split is primarily visual. The dessert, traditionally served in a glass
  boat, has so many textures, colors, and shapes that looking at it gives me the same
  satisfaction I feel when looking at a bowl of Trix Cereal or a freckled Tutti-Fruitti
  Jelly Belly. But the banana split is more enigmatic. It’s not a casual snack. There
  is no perfect occasion for such a dessert—it’s not traditionally served on birthdays,
  or any holiday, for that matter. And you can’t eat it on the go. </p>\n<p>With a
  craving, I began researching where to get the archetypal American dessert in Seattle—it
  was supposedly invented in Pennsylvania in 1904—but the only insight I found was
  a three-year-old Reddit post filled with more questions than answers and a 15-year-old
  Slog post (written by our own snack critic, Megan Seling), which cites establishments
  that are long gone. So, I did the lord’s work: I searched through every single diner,
  ice cream shop, and soda fountain menu in Seattle and Burien and mapped out a quest
  to acquire the old-fashioned sundae of my childhood dreams. </p>\n            <p>The
  banana split I yearn for is something close to the original early-20th-century invention:
  three types of ice cream (chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry), three sauces (fudge,
  strawberry sauce, and—and this is important!—crushed pineapple), whipped cream,
  and cherries, all composed between two lengthwise slices of a freshly peeled banana.
  After much online investigation, I was able to taste-test five banana splits over
  the course of three days (that’s a total of 15 scoops of ice cream) and send the
  receipts to my employer to make them pay for it. </p>\n<p>While I had expected a
  stomachache, I did not anticipate the psychological impact of asking for such an
  indulgent, inconvenient, impractical, and childish treat back-to-back in ice cream
  shops across the region. Each time I watched the server scramble around the kitchen
  for the menagerie of elements, I felt ashamed that I wasn’t ordering a simple ice
  cream cone.</p>\n<p>But I did it for you, Seattle.</p>\nThe Great American Diner
  &amp; Bar\n<p>$7.99</p>\n<p>I walked into the West Seattle Junction’s American Diner
  and was seated by a kind waitress who handed me a menu. “I actually already know
  what I want—can I just get the banana split?” I asked, sliding the menu back across
  the table. “Sure, I’ll go make that for you right now,” the waitress said with a
  tinge of panic in her eyes. Less than 10 minutes later, she returned with a large
  dinner plate topped with three scoops of ice cream (chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry)
  between two broken banana halves, and it was topped with whipped cream, chocolate
  sauce, almonds, and rainbow sprinkles. “Does that look okay?” she asked with uncertainty.
  I felt the need to validate that she did a great job. “Does anyone ever order this?”
  I asked. She threw her head back and laughed. “No, not while I’ve worked here!”
  she said, relieved. “I was nervous to make it, but it was actually very fun to decorate.” </p>\nBaskin-Robbins\n<p>$8.49</p>\n<p>The
  next day, I tracked down my nearest Baskin-Robbins. I was not expecting much from
  the strip mall chain in the Burien Safeway parking lot, but they delivered. As I
  walked in, I was relieved to see that they actually had a banana split on the TV
  screen menu with a glorious photo of the cherry-topped treat. Although once I told
  the teenager behind the counter what I wanted, I could feel her annoyance. She peeled
  and sliced a fresh banana, which I saw hanging on a special rack in the kitchen.
  She scooped the three flavors of ice cream—chocolate, strawberry, and vanilla—then
  doused them in three different sauces: marshmallow, hot fudge, and a jammy strawberry
  syrup. Then, she topped each scoop with a crown of whipped cream and three maraschino

  have been out of my view. The beautiful dessert, served in another special container
  (which was shaped like the DQ logo), was handed to me within seconds of placing
  the order. The quality was higher than you’d expect from a fast food chain—three
  twirls of vanilla soft serve between a surprisingly fresh banana, topped with crushed
  pineapple, strawberry sauce (with actual strawberry chunks!), chocolate syrup, and
  thin whipped dairy topping. Because Dairy Queen’s soft serve famously contains very

  was complete, the server told me to choose two toppings. I panicked and chose gummy

I did it for you, Seattle. by Audrey Vann

When was the last time you ate a banana split? I asked myself this question and drew a blank. I remember loving the indulgent triple-scoop sundae, and I was certain that I’d had one, but with no specific memory of when or why. Was this a false memory, shaped by a childhood full of banana split scratch-and-sniff stickers and images of wide-eyed children in books ogling them through shop windows?

The dessert, traditionally served in a glass boat, has so many textures, colors, and shapes that looking at it gives me the same satisfaction I feel when looking at a bowl of Trix Cereal or a freckled Tutti-Fruitti Jelly Belly. But the banana split is more enigmatic. It’s not a casual snack. There is no perfect occasion for such a dessert—it’s not traditionally served on birthdays, or any holiday, for that matter. And you can’t eat it on the go.&nbsp;

But I did it for you, Seattle.

The Great American Diner & Bar

$7.99

Baskin-Robbins

$8.49

The server seemed especially chipper and remarked, “I love making banana splits!” I have a feeling she wouldn’t have said this if the shop were not empty.&nbsp;

Lil’ Tiger Ice Cream

$11.25

On day three of the mission, I was mentally and physically burnt out on this dessert, so the fact that I enjoyed Lil’ Tiger’s banana split should say a lot. I was greeted with a sandwich board sign advertising banana splits, which felt like open arms outstretched to welcome me. The server didn’t blink an eye when I ordered, and asked me what flavors and toppings I’d like. I went with the classic ice cream flavors with hot fudge, strawberry syrup, whipped cream, and sprinkles, forgetting to add nuts. Lil’ Tiger’s homemade ice cream was decadent, soft, and flavorful. I found myself digging into the rich vanilla bean scoop more than any other, which is out of the norm for me.

“So, you feel bad about ordering it, even though it’s being offered on the menu?” my analyst asked me, at a regular appointment in the midst of my banana split marathon.
