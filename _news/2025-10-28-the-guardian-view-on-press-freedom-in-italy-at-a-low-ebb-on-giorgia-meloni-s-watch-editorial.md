The professional environment for journalists taking on powerful interests is worsening in a polarised climate

The so-called _anni di piombo_ ([years of lead](https://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/11/27/italians-are-still-haunted-by-the-years-of-lead)) remain a&nbsp;dark memory for Italians of a certain age. The semi-normalisation of political terrorism and mafia hits in the 1970s and 80s blighted civic life, and that brutal past continues to haunt the present. Forty-five years after the fact, a retired police officer has just been [arrested](https://palermo.gds.it/articoli/cronaca/2025/10/26/la-nuova-inchiesta-sul-delitto-mattarella-il-giallo-delle-targhe-false-e-delle-pistole-scomparse-7052622f-b3f6-45ec-b57c-e5bb5d4893b1/) in relation to the mafia killing in 1980 of Piersanti Mattarella, the then president of Sicily.

Unsurprisingly, given that history, the blowing up of a car belonging to one of Italy’s most famous investigative journalists has prompted an urgent and angst-ridden debate. Sigfrido Ranucci, who hosts a prime-time show on Rai, Italy’s state broadcaster, is known for presenting hard-hitting investigations into political corruption and organised crime. Earlier this month, a&nbsp;powerful bomb almost [destroyed](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/oct/17/italian-investigative-journalist-bomb-attack-sigfrido-ranucci) his black Mercedes, which was parked&nbsp;outside his home near Rome. The attack appeared to be timed to coincide with the eighth anniversary of the assassination of the Maltese investigative journalist [Daphne Caruana Galizia](https://www.daphne.foundation/en/about/daphne/).
