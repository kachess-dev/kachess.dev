original_content: "Three Films to Watch at the Orcas Island Film Festival&nbsp;\n
  by Charles Mudede \n\nI recall, as a young man, reading a line in Oscar Wilde’s&nbsp;_The
  Importance of Being Earnest_ and saying to myself: “This is the truth! The plain
  and simple truth!” Wilde, the saint of dandies, wrote in that play that: “When one
  is in town one amuses oneself. When one is in the country, one amuses other people.
  It is excessively boring.” This is exactly how I feel every time I leave the city.
  What am I going to do in the country or a town? I have never understood the “weekend
  getaway” or “the great outdoors.” Why must one get away from having lots of things
  to do to having nothing to do? As for the great outdoors, it can be found in many
  city parks.\n\nI bring all of this up because Orcas Island is, yes, outside of the
  city, but it’s a place where one “amuses oneself”: it has great restaurants, bars,
  art events. Of the last, one only has to mention the Orcas Island Film Festival,
  which runs, this year, between October 15 and 19. This festival is the very definition
  of boutique: it's small but devoted to the very best that world cinema has to offer.
  This is its reputation. And so, as a city person, you have two advantages on Orcas
  Island: lots of things to do, and a festival with high-grade films.\n\nNow, if I
  could, I would watch everything in this film festival. But I’m a mere mortal; I
  can only do so much, one day at a time. And so this is it: three recommended films
  in a festival with over 35 films.\n\n**_Orwell: 2+2=5_**  \n**Raoul Peck  \n(France
  **|** 159 minutes)**  \nI composed this review while visiting Portland, Oregon,
  my fourth favorite city. What was so terrifying about the place was how peaceful
  it was. And what was terrifying about this fact—people walking dogs, people visiting
  coffee shops, people biking, people in bars—was how it so easily disproved Trump's
  insistence that it's a war zone. Any television crew in the US could film and air
  this plain fact in minutes. But it wouldn't matter because, as Raoul Peck’s documentary
  makes clear, the US is in a very dark place. To say Portland is run by a terrorist
  organization and is burning to the ground is the same as saying: 2+2=5.&nbsp;\n\nPeck
  is known in the US for what I think is his weakest film, _I Am Not Your Negro,_
  a documentary about James Baldwin that was nominated for an Oscar in 2017. But Peck’s
  masterpieces number three: _Lumumba_ (2000), _The Young Karl Marx_ (2017), and his
  latest work, _Orwell: 2+2=5_ (2025). The last is a documentary that has three components.
  One: the class structure of what Fela Kuti famously called “colonial mentality.”
  Two: a humanizing portrait of a mythologically large 20th-century social commentator.
  And three: matching contemporary forms of authoritarianism with what’s described
  in the pages of Orwell’s most-famous books, _Animal Farm_ and _1984_. This is where
  Trump enters the picture. He and his kind, with the help of billionaires, are building
  a world that’s putting Big Brother in the shade. Peck, however, views Trump not
  as exceptional but systemic. There is nothing new about him. And what you will not
  find anywhere in the world is a political system that’s incapable of producing an
  authoritarian. This, I think, is Peck's ultimate message.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**_It Was
  Just an Accident_**   \n**Jafar Panahi**  \n**(Iran** | **104 minutes)**   \nIn
  2010, Iran convicted one of its greatest directors, Jafar Panahi, of “propaganda
  against the regime.” The filmmaker, who played a key role in the Iranian new wave
  movement of the 1990s, then spent the next 14 years in prison and house arrest,
  making, whenever possible, small clandestine films, some of which were shot on iPhones.
  Panahi returned to the international stage this year with a proper feature film,
  _It Was Just an Accident_, which screened at Cannes 2025 and NYFF 2025. (Panahi
  attended both events and, justly, received lots of praise and press.)&nbsp;\n\nNow,
  you'd think Panahi learned his lesson by now. That his first major film after serving
  time would be as careful as Asghar Farhadi’s _A Separation_. But no. He went right
  back to where left off in 2006 with _Offside_, one of his masterpieces, and continued
  his fierce (fearless) critique of the Iranian state, politics, and society. But
  there is much more to this new film, which concerns a group of people who’ve, by
  accident, captured the intelligence officer who brutally tortured them while they
  were detained by the secret police. Because they were blindfolded during interrogations,
  they are not 100 percent sure if the man they have in their hands is the monster.
  The film is a journey through this twilight. Should they kill him? Should they not?&nbsp;\n\n_Accident_
  ends with a shocking revelation. Panahi has decided to put not just the Iranian
  government on trial but the very state of our humanity. This film, which provides
  no easy answers, is certainly one of Panahi’s greatest works.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**_All
  That's Left of You_**  \n**Cherien Dabis**  \n**(Jordan** | **145 minutes)**  \nThe
  day I watched&nbsp;_All That's Left of You_, which provides a generational perspective
  of the plight of Palestinians, I saw on the BBC and Al Jazeera images of thousands
  upon thousands of people returning to what remained of Gaza. A truce between Hamas
  and the Israeli government had materialized a few days before. And even while that
  agreement’s ink was [still wet](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czew72350ngo),
  “large numbers [of people were heading] north up damaged narrow coastal roads towards
  the collapsed towers and ruined buildings of the territory's biggest city.”\n\nThe
  second feature by Cherien Dabis, a Palestinian American who is most known for directing
  episodes of the hit comedy-mystery series _Only Murders in the Building_, is made
  for tears, not laughs. _All That's Left of You_ begins, as philosophers like to
  say, at the beginning. The British are leaving and the Zionists are entering Mandatory
  Palestine. And so it's been one occupier (1920–1948); to another (1948–today). A
  citrus grower, Salim, loses his land, his means of making a living, and almost his
  family. As the years pass, the situation only gets worse and worse. The paradise
  of citrus groves becomes nothing more than a dream, and the present is shaped entirely
  by the harsh economic realities of an occupied West Bank. Dabis, who is also a star
  in the film, simply wants to tell this story. And she directed it with this clarity
  in mind. No distractions. Just look at the catastrophe directly and tell it like
  it is. The film has a lot of sorrow and several poetic moments. The damage of 1948
  is clearly far from resolved, even with the truce. All that’s happened is it's been
  kicked down the road like a can.&nbsp;\n\n[_Orcas Island Film Festival_](https://www.oifilmfest.org/)
