  Report offers no proof of wrongdoing but repeats disputed claims about Biden’s awareness of decisions in office

  US House Republicans on Tuesday unveiled their long-promised report on [Joe Biden](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden)’s use of the autopen during his presidency, largely rehashing public information while criticizing his time in office and making sweeping accusations about the workings of his White House.

  The [Republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans)’ report does not include any concrete evidence that aides conspired to enact policies without Biden’s knowledge or that he was unaware of laws, pardons or executive orders signed in his name. Nonetheless, Republicans maintained their findings cast doubt on Biden’s actions in office. And they sent a letter to Pam Bondi, the attorney general, urging a full investigation – after Donald Trump had [previously ordered a similar inquiry](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/05/joe-biden-dismisses-donald-trump-inquiry-into-his-cognitive-decline-as-a-distraction).

US House Republicans have revealed a report on President Joe Biden's use of the autopen, reviving public information and casting aspersions on his presidency, without presenting any solid proof of misconduct. The report does not prove that Biden's aides executed policies without his knowledge, or that he was oblivious to laws, pardons, or executive orders signed in his name. Despite this, Republicans have requested a full investigation from the attorney general, Pam Bondi, even though ex-President Donald Trump had previously commanded a similar inquiry. The report did not establish any proof of Biden's unawareness of decisions made during his presidency.
