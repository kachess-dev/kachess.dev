British journalist Sami Hamdi was detained by federal immigration authorities at San Francisco International Airport. The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) suggests the action was retaliation for Hamdi's criticism of Israel during his US tour. CAIR described the detainment as "a blatant affront to free speech," as Hamdi was criticizing Israel's military campaign in Gaza during his speaking tour. A Trump administration official announced Hamdi is facing deportation.
