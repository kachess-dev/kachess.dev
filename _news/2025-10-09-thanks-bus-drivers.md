  _Thank you to the operators and drivers who keep King County Metro operating and our community intact._

  _They are so often the kindhearted folks who see all of us at our best, and our worstâ€”after a few too many drinks at night; to and from stressful work days and packed school schedules; going on first dates and happy hours or final breakups and goodbyes; when our neighbors are experiencing a crisis and need some help, and so much more._

  _Public transit employees are the unsung heroes who keep us, and our community, connected._
