_They are so often the kindhearted folks who see all of us at our best, and our worst—after a few too many drinks at night; to and from stressful work days and packed school schedules; going on first dates and happy hours or final breakups and goodbyes; when our neighbors are experiencing a crisis and need some help, and so much more._

_Public transit employees are the unsung heroes who keep us, and our community, connected._
