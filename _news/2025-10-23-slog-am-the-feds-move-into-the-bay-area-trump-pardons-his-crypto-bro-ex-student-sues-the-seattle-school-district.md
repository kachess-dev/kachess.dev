  in our Food Issue. But apparently King County public health officials didn’t listen.
  They shut down <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/public-health-closes-13-unpermitted-food-vendors-operating-lumen-field-seattle/281-cbc51573-9b7c-4cd5-a228-87e95a1139ea\">17
  unpermitted food vendors</a> selling around Lumen Field during the Seahawks game
  earlier this week. It’s the latest in the county’s efforts to <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/king-county-illegal-food-cart-crack-down/281-e4dfce1d-26fb-40eb-99cf-d19ed06ba97d\">crack
  down on “illegal” street vending</a>, citing health risks and unfair competition
  for legal vendors.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of Shutdown:</strong> We’re on day 23
  of the government shutdown. While Trump has been trying to keep it low key, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/22/the-longer-the-shutdown-lasts-the-harder-it-is-to-mask-00618958\">Politico
  says</a> the effects could soon become unignorable. His administration is “scrambling”
  to fund WIC, Head Start, and troops. Airlines have seen delays due to air traffic
  control staffing shortages. “The longer the shutdown stretches on, the more cracks
  will form,” Politico wrote.</p>\n            <p><strong>Weather:</strong> Sporadic
  fog in the morning. Clouds and breaks of sun throughout the day. High of 63 degrees.
  Clouds, breeze and a touch of rain at night, and a low of 54.</p>\n<p><strong>Bad
  Teacher:</strong> In 2018, Meany Middle School math teacher James Johnson grabbed
  his 13-year-old student’s shirt, punched him in the jaw, dragged him across a table,
  and threw him out the classroom door. The next period, a student recorded him saying
  that he “had to punch a student in the face.” The student that he assaulted is 21
  now, and his lawyers say he’s suffered a traumatic brain injury and has depression,
  PTSD, and memory loss, and has been unable to stay employed. And they say that based
  on Johnson’s (alleged) history of shoving kids in lockers, using profanity in the
  classroom, and sexually harassing teenage girls, the school district should have
  known that Johnson was a risk to students. So now, the student that he assaulted
  is <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/seattle-student-punched-by-teacher-seeks-millions-in-damages/\">seeking
  between $76 million and $124 million</a> from Seattle Public Schools in damages
  in a King County Superior Court civil case.</p>\n<p><strong>We’re still doing this?</strong>
  On Tuesday, Tacoma City Council expanded the city’s <a href=\"https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article312606417.html\">homeless
  camping ban</a>, building on the ordinance established in 2022. The original ban
  prohibited camping and storage of personal belongings within a 10-block radius around
  temporary shelters and all public property within 200 feet of the city’s natural
  bodies of flowing water. The new proposal expands the ban to areas within two blocks
  of public schools, parks and libraries, and adds buffers around permanent shelters.</p>\n<p><strong>Overnight
  Orating:</strong> Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley delivered a nearly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/senator-jeff-merkley-floor-speech-trump\">23-hour
  speech</a> on the Senate floor, calling out President Trump for his authoritarian
  proclivities, prosecuting his political enemies and deploying the military to Portland.
  Merkley started speaking Tuesday and ended late Wednesday. “Trump is shredding our
  constitution,” he said.</p>\n<p><strong>From Portland to San Francisco:</strong>
  California’s Bay Area is the latest region facing federal agents in Trump’s anti-immigrant
  crackdown. More than 100 federal agents—including <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/sf-immigration-operation-21114328.php\">from
  U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a>—they arrived today in Alameda, a city across

The Stranger's Morning News Roundup by Micah Yip

**Rare Cop W:** After [learning](https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2025/10/21/leaving-the-door-wide-open/) that US Border Patrol had accessed their Flock Safety surveillance data through a backdoor in the system, the [Mukilteo, Auburn, Renton and Lakewood](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/feds-searched-flock-security-systems-at-18-wa-police-agencies-report/) police departments all revoked external access to that data.

**Street Vendor Shutdown:** Remember Charles Mudede’s love letter to street food vendors? “Seattle is growing. We are becoming big. And with a big city, comes big, delicious food tents,” he [wrote](https://www.thestranger.com/food-issue-2025/2025/10/03/80267011/big-city-big-street-food) in our Food Issue.

**Think You Have Measles?** The Washington Department of Health launched an [online tracker](https://wadoh.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/10e3b2b43f784eabbdb0a5873acd660d) this week showing locations [where people with measles visited](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/briefs/new-map-tracks-measles-exposures-across-washington/).
