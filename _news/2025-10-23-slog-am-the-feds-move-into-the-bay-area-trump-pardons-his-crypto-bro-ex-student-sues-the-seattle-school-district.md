original_content: "The Stranger's Morning News Roundup by Micah Yip\n\n**Rare Cop
  W:** After [learning](https://jsis.washington.edu/humanrights/2025/10/21/leaving-the-door-wide-open/)
  that US Border Patrol had accessed their Flock Safety surveillance data through
  a backdoor in the system, the [Mukilteo, Auburn, Renton and Lakewood](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/feds-searched-flock-security-systems-at-18-wa-police-agencies-report/)
  police departments all revoked external access to that data.\n\n**Street Vendor
  Shutdown:** Remember Charles Mudede’s love letter to street food vendors? “Seattle
  is growing. We are becoming big. And with a big city, comes big, delicious food
  tents,” he [wrote](https://www.thestranger.com/food-issue-2025/2025/10/03/80267011/big-city-big-street-food)
  in our Food Issue. But apparently King County public health officials didn’t listen.
  They shut down [17 unpermitted food vendors](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/public-health-closes-13-unpermitted-food-vendors-operating-lumen-field-seattle/281-cbc51573-9b7c-4cd5-a228-87e95a1139ea)
  selling around Lumen Field during the Seahawks game earlier this week. It’s the
  latest in the county’s efforts to [crack down on “illegal” street vending](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/king-county-illegal-food-cart-crack-down/281-e4dfce1d-26fb-40eb-99cf-d19ed06ba97d),
  citing health risks and unfair competition for legal vendors.\n\n**Speaking of Shutdown:**
  We’re on day 23 of the government shutdown. While Trump has been trying to keep
  it low key, [Politico says](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/10/22/the-longer-the-shutdown-lasts-the-harder-it-is-to-mask-00618958)
  the effects could soon become unignorable. His administration is “scrambling” to
  fund WIC, Head Start, and troops. Airlines have seen delays due to air traffic control
  staffing shortages. “The longer the shutdown stretches on, the more cracks will
  form,” Politico wrote.\n\n**Weather:** Sporadic fog in the morning. Clouds and breaks
  of sun throughout the day. High of 63 degrees. Clouds, breeze and a touch of rain
  at night, and a low of 54.\n\n**Bad Teacher:** In 2018, Meany Middle School math
  teacher James Johnson grabbed his 13-year-old student’s shirt, punched him in the
  jaw, dragged him across a table, and threw him out the classroom door. The next
  period, a student recorded him saying that he “had to punch a student in the face.”
  The student that he assaulted is 21 now, and his lawyers say he’s suffered a traumatic
  brain injury and has depression, PTSD, and memory loss, and has been unable to stay
  employed. And they say that based on Johnson’s (alleged) history of shoving kids
  in lockers, using profanity in the classroom, and sexually harassing teenage girls,
  the school district should have known that Johnson was a risk to students. So now,
  the student that he assaulted is [seeking between $76 million and $124 million](https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/seattle-student-punched-by-teacher-seeks-millions-in-damages/)
  from Seattle Public Schools in damages in a King County Superior Court civil case.\n\n**We’re
  still doing this?** On Tuesday, Tacoma City Council expanded the city’s [homeless
  camping ban](https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/article312606417.html), building
  on the ordinance established in 2022. The original ban prohibited camping and storage
  of personal belongings within a 10-block radius around temporary shelters and all
  public property within 200 feet of the city’s natural bodies of flowing water. The
  new proposal expands the ban to areas within two blocks of public schools, parks
  and libraries, and adds buffers around permanent shelters.\n\n**Overnight Orating:**
  Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley delivered a nearly [23-hour speech](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/22/senator-jeff-merkley-floor-speech-trump)
  on the Senate floor, calling out President Trump for his authoritarian proclivities,
  prosecuting his political enemies and deploying the military to Portland. Merkley
  started speaking Tuesday and ended late Wednesday. “Trump is shredding our constitution,”
  he said.\n\n**From Portland to San Francisco:** California’s Bay Area is the latest
  region facing federal agents in Trump’s anti-immigrant crackdown. More than 100
  federal agents—including [from U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/sf-immigration-operation-21114328.php)—they
  arrived today in Alameda, a city across the bay from San Francisco.\n\n**Here’s
  How They Were Greeted:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> [&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; View

  You Have Measles?** The Washington Department of Health launched an [online tracker](https://wadoh.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/10e3b2b43f784eabbdb0a5873acd660d)
  this week showing locations [where people with measles visited](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/briefs/new-map-tracks-measles-exposures-across-washington/).
  The tool comes amid a marked rise in measles cases nationwide, after RFK Jr. decided
  that the MMR vaccine was more dangerous than a virus that, before we were inoculated
  against it, killed 2.6 million people a year. Washington has seen 11 confirmed measles
  cases this year, but hasn’t seen an outbreak, which is defined as three or more
  related cases.\n\n**New Pentagon Press Corps:** After most major outlets refused
  to sign the Pentagon’s new media access policy, the “Department of War”&nbsp; unveiled
  a new press corps stocked with [right-wing “news” outlets](https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-media-rules-new-press-corps-b14b8cef6ba63cdac17c8ffac375e615)
  like the Gateway Pundit, the National Pulse, podcaster Tim Pool, Frontlines by Turning
  Point USA, and LindellTV run by “MyPillow” CEO Mike Lindell. It’s oozing with journalistic
  rigor, we hear.\n\n**Hit-and-Run in Ballard:** Seattle police are investigating
  a [fatal hit-and-run](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/police-respond-to-deadly-crash-ballard/281-2acee6db-7a7d-4e67-a737-88f32bb896a9?tbref=hp)
  Wednesday night in Ballard. Officers responded around 9 p.m. and found one person
  dead at the scene, according to KING 5. Details about the crash and the identity
  of the victim haven’t been released.\n\n**Big Tech Funds Trump’s Ballroom:** Trump
  is demolishing the White House East Wing for a $300 million ballroom. He said the
  renovation was funded by “[some friends of mine.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxn7lwzx5po)”
  Those friends turned out to be major [tech, defense, and crypto companies](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/trump-white-house-ballroom-donors)
  like Apple, Palantir and T-Mobile.\n\n**The War (On Crypto) Is Over:** At least,
  that’s what the White House said after Trump [pardoned Binance founder](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/trump-pardons-binance-founder-cz-zhao.html)
  Changpeng Zhao. Zhao was convicted less than a year ago for money laundering. He
  served four months in prison and paid a $4.3 billion settlement. The pardon comes
  on the heels of this [report](https://www.wsj.com/finance/currencies/trump-family-crypto-1e7ab14a?mod=article_inline)
  from the _Wall Street Journal_, which revealed Trump’s own family crypto company—which
  has generated about $4.5 billion since the 2024 election—was helped by “a partnership
  with an under-the-radar trading platform quietly administered by Binance.”"
