  Sombre documentary sees US soldiers give brave testimony while undergoing ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT treatment to confront their traumas

  A gaggle of former US Navy Seals open up about their post-traumatic stress in this absorbing if somewhat formulaic documentary by Jon Shenk and Bonni Cohen. Ultimately, it is something of an advertisement for a new therapeutic protocol that involves the veterans taking the hallucinogens [ibogaine](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/jan/23/ibogaine-iboga-drug-addiction-psychedelic-gabon) (derived from an African shrub) and [5-MeO-DMT](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/sep/10/celebrity-shoe-designer-patrick-cox-on-his-psychedelic-toad-awakening) (derived, like something out of a William S Burroughs novel, from a river toad); a treatment that, to hear the subjects here describe it, can work miracles on the battle-scarred, suicidal minds of its users. Currently, the treatment is only available at a Mexican clinic because the drugs have not been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration, but a bunch of boffins connected to [Stanford University’s Brain Stimulation Lab](https://bsl.stanford.edu/) are studying its clinical effects and the film works hard to make everything look as legit as possible.

  To be clear, we’re not necessarily questioning the drugs’ efficacy, but this particular film seems barely interested in the cognitive science and lets interviews with scientists with interesting glasses and fancy vocabularies stand in as guarantors that it all actually works. More persuasive is the testimony from the half dozen men we meet, who bravely discuss their pain and distress while the cameras roll.

"In Waves and War", a documentary by Jon Shenk and Bonni Cohen, features former US Navy Seals discussing their experiences with PTSD. The film primarily showcases a new therapeutic protocol where veterans are treated with the hallucinogens ibogaine and 5-MeO-DMT, derived respectively from an African shrub and a river toad. These treatments, currently only available in a Mexican clinic due to lack of FDA clearance, are described as highly effective for those with PTSD. Stanford University's Brain Stimulation Lab is studying their clinical effects. The film relies more on the veterans' powerful testimonies than scientific evidence.
