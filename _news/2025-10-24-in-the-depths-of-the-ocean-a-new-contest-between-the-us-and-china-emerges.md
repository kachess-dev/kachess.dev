  Around the Cook Islands, the worldâ€™s two most powerful countries are exploring the possibility of deep-sea mining for critical minerals

  Deep below the surface of the Pacific Ocean, the seafloor is dotted with clusters of brown and black rocks, each containing valuable metals.

  The rocks, known as polymetallic nodules, hold reserves of critical minerals that could be used to power clean energy and fuel a new industrial future. In the Cook Islands, a nation halfway between Hawaii and New Zealand, exploration vessels are mapping the mineral-rich seabeds.

The United States and China are investigating the potential for deep-sea mining for critical minerals around the Cook Islands. The Pacific Ocean seafloor in this region is abundant with polymetallic nodules, brown and black rocks containing valuable metals. These reserves could be instrumental in powering clean energy and driving a new industrial era. Exploration vessels are currently mapping these mineral-rich seabeds.
