Ten individuals are on trial in France, accused of sexist harassment directed at the country's First Lady, Brigitte Macron. The judge presiding over the case stated that the defendants have caused significant 'deterioration' to Macron's 'physical and mental health'. The trial comes in the wake of a broader discussion about sexism in French society and the need for stricter laws to protect individuals from such harassment.
