Patrick Gelsinger, former CEO of Intel, has taken charge at Gloo, a tech firm catering to the "faith ecosystem", after being ousted from Intel and facing a shareholder lawsuit. Gloo's technology aids churches and automates pastoral and ministry support through chatbots and AI assistants. This shift in Gelsinger's career comes as the US tech industry, including several of its leaders, is increasingly focusing on politics as a significant revenue source. They have contributed to Donald Trump's re-election campaign and are keenly pursuing government contracts as religious conservatism experiences a resurgence during Trump's second term.
