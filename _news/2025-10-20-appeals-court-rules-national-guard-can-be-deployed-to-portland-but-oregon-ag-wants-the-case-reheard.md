  Oregon Attorney General's Office is requesting a review by a full appeals court
  after the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled Monday that President Donald
  Trump can deploy the National Guard in Portland.</p>\n<p>The 9th Circuit ruling
  paves the way for the federal government to occupy the city.</p>\n<p>The ruling,
  handed down more than a week after the court heard oral arguments from attorneys
  for the Department of Justice and the state of Oregon, is a legal success for the
  Trump administration, after courts have blocked or slowed its efforts to occupy
  other major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago. </p>\n            <p>In a statement
  following the ruling, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat, called for
  the full 9th Circuit to intervene to stop the deployment of troops on city streets.</p>\n<p>“Today’s
  ruling, if allowed to stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon
  soldiers on our streets with almost no justification,” Rayfield said. “We are on
  a dangerous path in America.”</p>\n<p>Rayfield, along with Governor Tina Kotek,
  vowed to continue fighting the decision in court. Attorneys for the state of Oregon
  filed a request for the case to be quickly reconsidered by a full appeals court.
  Monday's ruling was decided by a panel of three judges. </p>\n<p>Meanwhile, National
  Guard troops are temporarily restricted from deploying, pending a district court's
  decision on a temporary restraining order that remains in effect until next Wednesday.
  The US Department of Justice on Monday requested that restraining order be dissolved
  by the judge who issued it, arguing the 9th Circuit ruling should supersede that
  of the district court.</p>\n<p>The 9th Circuit for years had a reputation as one
  of the country’s most liberal appeals courts, but two of the three judges who heard
  attorneys’ arguments in the case were Trump appointees—and their votes were decisive
  in the court’s 2-1 ruling. </p>\n<p>The majority opinion holds that the Trump administration’s
  presentation of Portland as dangerous enough to warrant federal intervention is
  credible, even if “the President may exaggerate the extent of the problem on social
  media.”</p>\n<p>“We conclude that the President’s assessment of the situation in
  Portland—specifically, the threat to federal personnel and property, and the resulting
  inability to execute federal laws— ‘reflects a colorable assessment of the facts
  and law within a ‘range of honest judgment,’” the opinion reads.</p>\n<p>The writing
  was on the wall for the state during oral arguments earlier this month, when the
  two Trump-appointed judges pushed back against the state’s presentation of the protests
  at the ICE facility on S Macadam Ave as largely peaceful.</p>\n<p>Much of the discussion
  in court centered on the question of how dangerous recent protests in Portland have
  been and whether they constitute a “rebellion,” with the state and the federal government
  taking drastically divergent positions.</p>\n<p>Stacy Chaffin, the attorney representing
  the state, said Trump’s depiction of Portland as “war ravaged” was “untethered from
  reality” and maintained that local law enforcement has capably handled what little
  criminal activity the city has seen in recent weeks and does not require federal
  assistance. </p>\n\n<p>“The situations that we're talking about, even the situations
  where it unfortunately could include an assault on a federal officer, that's a crime.
  That's a crime that was handled. They were arrested,” Chaffin said during the hearing.
  “That's how this process is supposed to work. It's not that there is a protest,
  and then you just send in the military. This is protected speech, and for the most
  part, it is calm and sedate.”</p>\n<p>Recent protests at the ICE building have mainly
  been small and mainly nonviolent. But Eric McArthur, the deputy attorney general
  representing the federal government, argued they have involved property damage and
  constitute a rebellion that necessitates a guard presence.</p>\n<p>In making his
  argument, McArthur’s rhetoric about the protests hewed closer to Trump’s.</p>\n<p>“This
  is hardly the peaceful and sedate crowd that plaintiffs tried to make it out to
  be,” McArthur said in closing. “These are violent people. And if at any point we
  let down our guard, there is a serious risk of ongoing violence.”</p>\n<p>McArthur
  suggested the pressure from protestors has left Trump with little choice other than
  to send in federal troops. </p>\n<p>“At some point, the president is entitled, when
  his subordinates are telling him, ‘We are overstretched, this is unsustainable,’
  the officers aren’t available to do their jobs, they’re not available to surge to
  other places where we face violence, the president is entitled to say ‘enough is
  enough,’ and bring in the National Guard to reinforce the regular forces,” McArthur
  added.</p>\n<p>The judges seemed inclined to agree, pressing for details about the
  nature of the protests and pushing Chaffin to clarify the state of Oregon’s position
  on when it is appropriate for courts to intervene to block the president from deploying
  federal troops—suggesting that events from the summer may be grounds enough for
  Trump to send in troops.</p>\n<p>“The president gets to direct his resources as
  he deems fit, and it just seems a little counterintuitive to me that the city of
  Portland can come in and say ‘No. You need to do it differently,’” Judge Ryan Nelson
  said at one point. </p>\n<p>Their ruling is just the latest development in a battle
  over the legality of the Trump administration’s attempt to deploy federal troops
  to Portland. </p>\n<p>On September 27, Trump announced in a Truth Social post that
  he was directing Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense, to “provide all necessary
  Troops to protect War ravaged Portland” and that he was authorizing “Full Force,
  if necessary,” in the city. Hegseth then federalized 200 members of the Oregon National
  Guard for a period of 60 days. </p>\n<p>The state of Oregon, in response, sued to
  block the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard troops in Portland—arguing

In a 2-1 decision, the 9th Circuit Court says president has authority to deploy the military to Portland, amid ongoing protests at the ICE facility.&nbsp;

The Oregon Attorney General's Office is requesting a review by a full appeals court after the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled Monday that President Donald Trump can deploy the National Guard in Portland.

The 9th Circuit ruling paves the way for the federal government to occupy the city.

The ruling, handed down more than a week after the court heard oral arguments from attorneys for the Department of Justice and the state of Oregon, is a legal success for the Trump administration, after courts have blocked or slowed its efforts to occupy other major cities like Los Angeles and Chicago.&nbsp;

In a statement following the ruling, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat, called for the full 9th Circuit to intervene to stop the deployment of troops on city streets.

The writing was on the wall for the state during oral arguments earlier this month, when the two Trump-appointed judges pushed back against the state’s presentation of the protests at the ICE facility on S Macadam Ave as largely peaceful.

Much of the discussion in court centered on the question of how dangerous recent protests in Portland have been and whether they constitute a “rebellion,” with the state and the federal government taking drastically divergent positions.
