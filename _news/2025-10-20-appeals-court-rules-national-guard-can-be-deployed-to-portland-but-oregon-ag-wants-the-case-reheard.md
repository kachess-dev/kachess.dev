  to deploy the military to Portland, amid ongoing protests at the ICE facility.&nbsp;\n
  by Abe Asher \n\n_Editor's Note: This story originally appeared in our sister publication,_
  Portland Mercury_. We will be posting dispatches from Portland as they become available._\n\nThe
  Oregon Attorney General's Office is requesting a review by a full appeals court
  after the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled Monday that President Donald
  Trump can deploy the National Guard in Portland.\n\nThe 9th Circuit ruling paves
  the way for the federal government to occupy the city.\n\nThe ruling, handed down
  more than a week after the court heard oral arguments from attorneys for the Department
  of Justice and the state of Oregon, is a legal success for the Trump administration,
  after courts have blocked or slowed its efforts to occupy other major cities like
  Los Angeles and Chicago.&nbsp;\n\nIn a statement following the ruling, Oregon Attorney
  General Dan Rayfield, a Democrat, called for the full 9th Circuit to intervene to
  stop the deployment of troops on city streets.\n\n“Today’s ruling, if allowed to
  stand, would give the president unilateral power to put Oregon soldiers on our streets
  with almost no justification,” Rayfield said. “We are on a dangerous path in America.”\n\nRayfield,
  along with Governor Tina Kotek, vowed to continue fighting the decision in court.
  Attorneys for the state of Oregon filed a request for the case to be quickly reconsidered
  by a full appeals court. Monday's ruling was decided by a panel of three judges.&nbsp;\n\nMeanwhile,
  National Guard troops are temporarily restricted from deploying, pending a district
  court's decision on a temporary restraining order that remains in effect until next
  Wednesday. The US Department of Justice on Monday requested that restraining order
  be dissolved by the judge who issued it, arguing the 9th Circuit ruling should supersede
  that of the district court.\n\nThe 9th Circuit for years had a reputation as one
  of the country’s most liberal appeals courts, but two of the three judges who heard
  attorneys’ arguments in the case were Trump appointees—and their votes were decisive
  in the court’s 2-1 ruling.&nbsp;\n\nThe majority opinion holds that the Trump administration’s
  presentation of Portland as dangerous enough to warrant federal intervention is
  credible, even if “the President may exaggerate the extent of the problem on social
  media.”\n\n“We conclude that the President’s assessment of the situation in Portland—specifically,
  the threat to federal personnel and property, and the resulting inability to execute
  federal laws— ‘reflects a colorable assessment of the facts and law within a ‘range
  of honest judgment,’” the opinion reads.\n\nThe writing was on the wall for the
  state during oral arguments earlier this month, when the two Trump-appointed judges
  pushed back against the state’s presentation of the protests at the ICE facility
  on S Macadam Ave as largely peaceful.\n\nMuch of the discussion in court centered
  on the question of how dangerous recent protests in Portland have been and whether
  they constitute a “rebellion,” with the state and the federal government taking
  drastically divergent positions.\n\nStacy Chaffin, the attorney representing the
  state, said Trump’s depiction of Portland as “war ravaged” was “untethered from
  reality” and maintained that local law enforcement has capably handled what little
  criminal activity the city has seen in recent weeks and does not require federal
  assistance.&nbsp;\n\n“The situations that we're talking about, even the situations
  where it unfortunately could include an assault on a federal officer, that's a crime.
  That's a crime that was handled. They were arrested,” Chaffin said during the hearing.
  “That's how this process is supposed to work. It's not that there is a protest,
  and then you just send in the military. This is protected speech, and for the most
  part, it is calm and sedate.”\n\nRecent protests at the ICE building have mainly
  been small and mainly nonviolent. But Eric McArthur, the deputy attorney general
  representing the federal government, argued they have involved property damage and
  constitute a rebellion that necessitates a guard presence.\n\nIn making his argument,
  McArthur’s rhetoric about the protests hewed closer to Trump’s.\n\n“This is hardly
  the peaceful and sedate crowd that plaintiffs tried to make it out to be,” McArthur
  said in closing. “These are violent people. And if at any point we let down our
  guard, there is a serious risk of ongoing violence.”\n\nMcArthur suggested the pressure
  from protestors has left Trump with little choice other than to send in federal
  troops.&nbsp;\n\n“At some point, the president is entitled, when his subordinates
  are telling him, ‘We are overstretched, this is unsustainable,’ the officers aren’t
  available to do their jobs, they’re not available to surge to other places where
  we face violence, the president is entitled to say ‘enough is enough,’ and bring
  in the National Guard to reinforce the regular forces,” McArthur added.\n\nThe judges
  seemed inclined to agree, pressing for details about the nature of the protests
  and pushing Chaffin to clarify the state of Oregon’s position on when it is appropriate
  for courts to intervene to block the president from deploying federal troops—suggesting
  that events from the summer may be grounds enough for Trump to send in troops.\n\n“The
  president gets to direct his resources as he deems fit, and it just seems a little
  counterintuitive to me that the city of Portland can come in and say ‘No. You need
  to do it differently,’” Judge Ryan Nelson said at one point.&nbsp;\n\nTheir ruling
  is just the latest development in a battle over the legality of the Trump administration’s
  attempt to deploy federal troops to Portland.&nbsp;\n\nOn September 27, Trump announced
  in a Truth Social post that he was directing Pete Hegseth, the Secretary of Defense,
  to “provide all necessary Troops to protect War ravaged Portland” and that he was
  authorizing “Full Force, if necessary,” in the city. Hegseth then federalized 200
  members of the Oregon National Guard for a period of 60 days.&nbsp;\n\nThe state
  of Oregon, in response, sued to block the Trump administration from deploying the
  National Guard troops in Portland—arguing that, contrary to the president’s rhetoric,
  the city was peaceful and such a deployment would under the circumstances violate
  the state’s sovereignty.&nbsp;\n\nA federal judge agreed, and granted the state
  a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from deploying Oregon
  National Guard troops in Portland through October 18.\n\nThe Trump administration,
  in response to that legal setback, decided to deploy another state’s National Guard
  troops to the city instead—sending 300 members of the California National Guard
  to Portland.\n\nThat workaround was also quickly blocked by the same judge, US District
  Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, who issued a second restraining order preventing
  the Trump administration from sending National Guard troops from other states to
  Portland.&nbsp;\n\nThe Trump administration appealed Immergut’s ruling, which landed
  the state and the federal government back in court.\n\nBefore Monday’s decision,
  National Guard troops were forced to wait for further developments at posts outside
  the city they were barred from entering. Members of the Oregon National Guard were
  stationed at Camp Rilea in Warrenton, while members of the California National Guard
  were biding their time at Camp Withycombe on the outskirts of Happy Valley. Guard
  troops were later sent home, pending legal decisions.\n\nPortland is not the only
  place a major court case over the president’s use of National Guard troops is currently
  playing out. The 7th Circuit has blocked the Trump administration from deploying
  federal troops in Chicago, a decision the Trump administration has appealed to the
  Supreme Court. &nbsp;\n\nThe ongoing battles in Portland and Chicago could have
  grave consequences for the practice of federalism and states’ rights, as both cases
  have turned on the question of how much latitude the president has to deploy the
  US military to American cities over the objections of their local elected leadership.&nbsp;\n\nIllinois
  Gov. JB Pritzker has characterized the presence of federal troops in Chicago as
  an “unconstitutional invasion of Illinois” by the federal government, while Oregon
  Gov. Tina Kotek called the deployment of Texas National Guard troops to the state
  “un-American” and said she is fighting for “the right to govern ourselves.”\n\nTrump
  yesterday called for the arrest of Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brendan Johnson. The
  administration has also sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles and Washington,
  D.C. in recent months. &nbsp;\n\nAs the 9th Circuit was hearing arguments earlier
  this month, Kristi Noem, the secretary of Homeland Security, told a Trump cabinet
  meeting that her department is looking to purchase more facilities in Portland and
  threatened to expand the federal law enforcement presence in the city if local elected
  officials do not cooperate with the administration.&nbsp;\n\n“We’re going to double
  down,” she said."

The US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit ruled that President Donald Trump can deploy the National Guard in Portland amid ongoing protests at the ICE facility. The Oregon Attorney General's Office has requested a review by a full appeals court. The ruling is viewed as a legal success for the Trump administration. However, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield warned that this ruling could give the president unilateral power to deploy soldiers on the streets. National Guard deployment is temporarily restricted pending a district court's decision on a temporary restraining order.
