  António Guterres said the UN is ready to scale up food, water, shelter, and medical

  is still on a razor’s edge, but today, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/09/world/israel-hamas-gaza-ceasefire/14922055-b7e2-5884-aba8-f6ef5fe7fd91?smid=url-share\">Palestinians</a>

  are celebrating in the streets. </p>\n            <p><strong>Higher Education’s
  Situationship: </strong>Since Trump took aim at most of our higher education system
  at the top of his term, our major universities have been trying to figure out how
  to coexist with this administration—and most of them are deciding that a lil’ acquiescence
  is worth the hundreds of millions of dollars they want to keep from the federal
  government. Last week, the Trump administration sent letters to nine universities
  offering to put them at the front of the line for federal research funding if they
  align their campus with his administration. Instead of telling Trump where to shove
  it, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/politics/harvard-trump-research-money.html\"><em>New
  York Times</em></a>, Harvard officials are weighing their options—what’s a liiiittle
  authoritarianism, if they get to keep their funding?</p>\n<p><strong>If everything
  you just read made you a little queasy, </strong>I recommend this <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/opinion/trump-universities-compact-civil-society.html\">guest
  essay</a> in <em>NYT</em> by a professor of democracy at Johns Hopkins. The attack
  on the university system is part of “Trump’s bigger agenda to remake American politics
  so that everyone wants to be his friend and no one dares to be his enemy,” he writes.
  “If the administration can reshape politics in such a way, it can create an enduring
  advantage for itself, as Prime Minister Viktor Orbán of Hungary and President Recep
  Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey have done.” They win when society cracks, he writes. So
  it’s on universities to find solidarity with other institutions, not Trump. “Those
  who oppose authoritarianism have to play a different game, creating solidarity among
  an unwieldy coalition, which knows that if everyone holds together, they will surely
  succeed.”</p>\n<p><strong>Seattle’s Trolls Go to the White House: </strong>On Wednesday,
  Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/video-clips/5545538-watch-live-trump-white-house-roundtable-antifa/\">held</a>
  an “Antifa Roundtable” and invited the internet’s worst people. The PNW’s far-right
  media contingent was well represented: Brandi Kruse told Trump that she used to
  suffer from “Trump Derangement Syndrome,” but now that she’s on board, she’s “happier,”
  “more healthy,” and “I think I’m even a little more attractive.” Jonathan Choe,
  who was there on behalf of Charlie Kirk’s TurningPoint USA, told Trump that he should
  be keeping an eye on Seattle’s Democratic Socialists of America, because their “research”
  says the DSA is “behind antifa.” Andy Ngo, Katie Daviscourt, and Nick Sortor all
  told their horror stories of their fight against antifa, and Trump told them they
  were very pretty.</p>\n<p><strong>The Ruse: </strong>The Roundtable was all part
  of Trump’s attempt to validate his belief that we’re in a civil war. Turns out,
  not even federal law enforcement believe that. Before Trump said he was going to
  send the National Guard to Portland, federal law enforcement reported that the protests
  were “low energy.” (Rude.) <em>NYT</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/us/politics/trump-portland-troops.html\">reports</a>
  that the on-the-ground info from the feds “offered no indication of a dangerous
  escalation of tensions, or unusual levels of protest activity that would prompt
  the level of alarm expressed by Mr. Trump.” </p>\n<p><strong>The Government Is Still
  Shutdown. </strong>That’s it. That’s the tweet.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump Bombed Colombian
  Citizens: </strong>Remember when Trump attacked an alleged Venezuelan drug smuggling
  boat in the Caribbean? The president of Colombia <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/08/world/americas/colombia-citizens-boat-us-bombed.html?smid=url-share\">says</a>
  the boat was Colombian, and carrying Colombian citizens. “A new war zone has opened
  up,” he tweeted, without elaboration.</p>\n<p><strong>How are you coping with all
  this? </strong>We all have our vices, but don’t do it with 7 pounds of gummy cola
  bottles, okay? A man in the UK <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/man-hospitalized-after-eating-nearly-7-pounds-of-gummies-in-3-days/\">put
  himself in the hospital</a> after scoring a bulk bag of the gummies for just 22
  bucks, and housing them in three days. Don’t do that.</p>\n<p><strong>But What About
  the Big One?? </strong>Last night we had our last major, televised <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMEVw-l58JU\">debate</a>
  in the race for the mayor’s office, moderated by KOMO’s Chris Daniels, Seattle U’s
  professional-in-residence Joni Balter, and Seattle U student Diego Borromeo. We
  saw a lot of the same: Harrell insisting that Wilson doesn’t have the experience
  necessary to run the city; Wilson touting 14 years of coalition building that says
  otherwise. The vibes were… off. Doing her best Sara Nelson impression, Balter scolded
  the crowd of students any time they cheered for Wilson—claiming that it was eating
  into time for more questions. And the moderators threw in some of the weirdest “gotchas”
  I’ve seen yet. They asked Wilson what she would do if an earthquake hit the region,
  a non-political emergency prep question that was really just a thinly veiled attempt
  at taking their own dig at her experience. And then gave her a series of “yes/no”
  questions about whether or not she’s a Sawant-style socialist (which they then posed
  to Harrell, and allowed him to ramble on and on and on…). Can we go back to boycotting
  Sinclair media?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Balter's got a round of gotcha questions!
  WHAT KIND OF A SOCIALIST ARE YOU KATIE?? Do you support decriminalizing prostitution?
  A rent freeze? A $30 minimum wage in five years? ARE YOU KSHAMA, KATIE???</p>\n—
