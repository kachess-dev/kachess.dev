  With four races left, divining the F1 title destination is tricky but the smart money would go on Lando Norris

  Ordinarily at this point in the Formula One season, form has been settled. This year, with four meetings remaining, the title run-in reaches its decisive phase with a three-way fight between the McLarens of Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri and the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Divining the outcome is a decidedly tricky affair.

The Formula One season approaches its final four races with a three-way battle for the title between McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, and Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Earlier, it seemed the championship would be a duel between Norris and Piastri, but recent Red Bull upgrades have complicated the equation. The performance of the upgraded RB21 can now match or surpass McLaren's, although the margins are slim and it's uncertain who will have the advantage in upcoming races.
