original_content: "The Stranger's Morning News Roundup\n by Hannah Murphy Winter \n\n**Good
  morning!** After Sunday’s wild, chaotic patchwork of sun showers, we’re getting
  a break from the rain. For the next few days, it’ll be partly sunny with highs in
  the low 60s. Get outside. The Big Dark starts in 13 days.\n\nBut first, the news.\n\n**Seattle’s
  Best Inflatables Hit the Streets:** On Saturday, 90,000 protesters hit the streets
  for the No Kings march in Seattle, according to an initial estimate from the organizers.
  If their guess is right, this march beat the first No Kings march by 20k, and amounts
  to about 11 percent of the city’s population. It’s clear that Seattle doesn’t know
  what our answer to Portland’s protest frogs are. There were inflatable axolotls,
  inflatable sumo wrestlers, inflatable unicorns, inflatable dinosaurs, an inflatable
  St. Rat. But our sign game was solid.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> [&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

  the march haters:** I hear you. You feel like these marches are a way for libs to
  get their anti-Trump out without actually doing anything. A way for cis, straight,
  white, wealthy people with less on the line to anoint themselves with a gold anti-fascist
  star. And you’re right that this isn’t the frontline fight. This isn’t the protests
  outside ICE facilities or immigration courts or federal buildings. This is a rally.
  Rallies are silly and energetic and they provide a wide-ass umbrella. And that’s
  not a bad thing. Making dissenters feel powerless is one of the essential tenets
  of an authoritarian government. And rallies—whether they’re before a sports game
  or against a government—their job is to make you feel like you’re part of something
  big and powerful. Seven million people marched against the sitting president of
  the United States on Saturday. And it’s a lot easier to do your part, whatever that
  is, when you have hope. When you feel like you’re a part of something. And when
  you know you’re not alone.\n\n**Plus, visible shows of dissent** create a [PR problem](https://theintercept.com/2025/10/18/no-kings-protests-trump-fascism/)
  for MAGA that they don’t know how to deal with, so then…\n\n**Trump Blows His Load:**
  Our Dear Leader didn’t enjoy knowing that 7 million people were marching in the
  streets with signs calling him a turd, so he took matters into his own tiny hands.
  On Saturday night, he posted an AI-generated video of him climbing into the cockpit
  of a fighter jet painted with “King Trump.” To the tune of “Danger Zone”—with an
  oxygen mask on his chin—Top Trump dumps piles of liquid shit over protesters in
  New York. Not to be one-upped, JD Vance then posted a video of Trump being crowned,
  which cuts to what appears to be video of the Democratic leadership kneeling during
  their incredibly cringey Black Lives Matter media stunt.\n\n**Meanwhile, in Real
  Life:** Actual Vance gave a speech on [Saturday](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/18/us/artillery-interstate-5-marines.html)
  in front of hundreds of US Marines (none of them fat or bearded, we assume), ranting
  about Senator Chuck Schumer and the government shutdown. Then, Vance watched Marines
  fire 155-millimeter artillery shells over a major interstate highway, while parachuters
  jumped from the sky and Navy seals swam out of the ocean. Vance called the whole
  fever dream “testament to the corps’ strength and unbeatable power.”\n\n**First
  “Antifa” “Terrorism” Charges Are In:** On Thursday, federal prosecutors [announced](https://theintercept.com/2025/10/17/antifa-ice-protesters-terrorism-texas-prairieland/)
  that terrorism charges had been [filed against](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.410488/gov.uscourts.txnd.410488.79.0.pdf)
  two people for their alleged involvement in a shooting that injured a police officer
  during a July 4 ICE protest in Alvarado, Texas. It’s been about a month since Trump
  shouted on social media that he was going to designate “antifa” a “major terrorist
  organization,” which isn’t technically possible for domestic groups in the US. But
  anything is possible if you make up your own rules, and that’s just what Trump did.\n\n**What
  are they actually charged with?** Neither of them are accused of shooting the gun.
  Instead, the government accused them of “providing material support to terrorists”
  and having “aided and abetted” the alleged attempted murder of the cop. It also
  accuses them of being part of an “antifa cell.” Because there’s no such thing as
  a centralized Antifa organization, that means nothing. But this case will be Pam
  Bondi’s testing ground for using this terrorist designation as a form of repression.\n\n**Speaking
  of Shit Trump Made Up:** Trump’s undeclared war on narcotraffic in the Caribbean
  is still roaring. On Thursday, the US military hit its sixth boat that they claim
  is carrying drug traffickers, and unlike the previous five strikes, this one left
  [two survivors](https://theintercept.com/2025/10/17/caribbean-boat-strike-survivors-prisoners-war-navy/).
  They’re now theoretically prisoners of war? In a war that was never declared or
  approved by Congress. At least 29 people have been killed in these extrajudicial
  killings (murders), and Trump is now flirting with continuing these attacks on land
  in Venezuela.\n\n**A Broken Ceasefire:** On Sunday, ten days into a fragile truce,
  Israel [launched](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/19/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-ceasefire.html)
  an attack on Gaza and halted aid deliveries. In a truly spectacular use of doublespeak,
  Israeli officials said the attacks were “enforcement of the cease-fire.” Israel
  claims that two of its soldiers were killed by “Palestinian militants” on Sunday
  before they launched the attack. Gaza’s health officials reported that 44 Palestinians
  died in Israel’s bombing. Both Israel and Hamas accuse the other of breaking the
  ceasefire, and both Israel and Hamas say they’re still committed to it.\n\n**Ocean’s
  Four:** On Sunday, in broad daylight, two [burglars](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/19/world/europe/louvre-paris-robbery.html)
  drove a truck carrying an electric-powered ladder to the Louvre, climbed up to the
  second floor and broke a window into the gallery holding a collection of royal jewels.
  They smashed two cases and nabbed eight objects, including a royal sapphire necklace
  and a diadem worn by Empress Eugénie. Then they shot back down the ladder, and hopped
  on two scooters driven by their getaway drivers. The heist took seven minutes.\n\n**It’s
  Election Time:** By now, your ballot has probably arrived in your mailbox. Our general
  election [voters' guide](https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/10/17/80286641/the-strangers-general-election-2025-voting-guide)

  Takes All:** We can’t say the Mariners aren’t keeping it exciting. We’re now 3-3
  in a seven game series against the Toronto Blue Jays, and tonight’s game will decide
  who goes to the World Series. The Mariners are the only MLB team never to go to
  the Series, and this is the closest they’ve ever gotten, which means at 5:08 p.m.
  today they’re starting the biggest game in the team’s history. Everybody be cool.\n\n**Here’s

On Saturday, approximately 90,000 protesters participated in the No Kings march in Seattle, making it one of the largest ever in the city. The march featured various inflatables and signs. Despite criticism, the rallies are seen as a crucial show of dissent and unity. Elsewhere, the first Antifa terrorism charges were filed against two individuals for alleged involvement in a shooting during an ICE protest. Further, a fragile truce in Israel has broken as an attack was launched on Gaza. In lighter news, a daring broad daylight robbery took place at the Louvre, and Seattle Mariners are poised for their first-ever World Series appearance.
