  the march haters: </strong>I hear you. You feel like these marches are a way for
  libs to get their anti-Trump out without actually doing anything. A way for cis,
  straight, white, wealthy people with less on the line to anoint themselves with
  a gold anti-fascist star. And you’re right that this isn’t the frontline fight.
  This isn’t the protests outside ICE facilities or immigration courts or federal
  buildings. This is a rally. Rallies are silly and energetic and they provide a wide-ass
  umbrella. And that’s not a bad thing. Making dissenters feel powerless is one of
  the essential tenets of an authoritarian government. And rallies—whether they’re
  before a sports game or against a government—their job is to make you feel like
  you’re part of something big and powerful. Seven million people marched against
  the sitting president of the United States on Saturday. And it’s a lot easier to
  do your part, whatever that is, when you have hope. When you feel like you’re a
  part of something. And when you know you’re not alone.</p>\n<p><strong>Plus, visible
  shows of dissent</strong> create a <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2025/10/18/no-kings-protests-trump-fascism/\">PR
  problem</a> for MAGA that they don’t know how to deal with, so then…</p>\n<p><strong>Trump
  Blows His Load: </strong>Our Dear Leader didn’t enjoy knowing that 7 million people
  were marching in the streets with signs calling him a turd, so he took matters into
  his own tiny hands. On Saturday night, he posted an AI-generated video of him climbing
  into the cockpit of a fighter jet painted with “King Trump.” To the tune of “Danger
  Zone”—with an oxygen mask on his chin—Top Trump dumps piles of liquid shit over
  protesters in New York. Not to be one-upped, JD Vance then posted a video of Trump
  being crowned, which cuts to what appears to be video of the Democratic leadership
  kneeling during their incredibly cringey Black Lives Matter media stunt.</p>\n<p><strong>Meanwhile,
  in Real Life: </strong>Actual Vance gave a speech on <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/18/us/artillery-interstate-5-marines.html\">Saturday</a>
  in front of hundreds of US Marines (none of them fat or bearded, we assume), ranting
  about Senator Chuck Schumer and the government shutdown. Then, Vance watched Marines
  fire 155-millimeter artillery shells over a major interstate highway, while parachuters
  jumped from the sky and Navy seals swam out of the ocean. Vance called the whole
  fever dream “testament to the corps’ strength and unbeatable power.”</p>\n<p><strong>First
  “Antifa” “Terrorism” Charges Are In: </strong>On Thursday, federal prosecutors <a

  that terrorism charges had been <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.410488/gov.uscourts.txnd.410488.79.0.pdf\">filed
  against</a> two people for their alleged involvement in a shooting that injured
  a police officer during a July 4 ICE protest in Alvarado, Texas. It’s been about
  a month since Trump shouted on social media that he was going to designate “antifa”
  a “major terrorist organization,” which isn’t technically possible for domestic
  groups in the US. But anything is possible if you make up your own rules, and that’s
  just what Trump did.</p>\n<p><strong>What are they actually charged with?</strong>
  Neither of them are accused of shooting the gun. Instead, the government accused
  them of “providing material support to terrorists” and having “aided and abetted”
  the alleged attempted murder of the cop. It also accuses them of being part of an
  “antifa cell.” Because there’s no such thing as a centralized Antifa organization,
  that means nothing. But this case will be Pam Bondi’s testing ground for using this
  terrorist designation as a form of repression.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of Shit

  an attack on Gaza and halted aid deliveries. In a truly spectacular use of doublespeak,
  Israeli officials said the attacks were “enforcement of the cease-fire.” Israel
  claims that two of its soldiers were killed by “Palestinian militants” on Sunday

The Stranger's Morning News Roundup
 by Hannah Murphy Winter 

**Good morning!** After Sunday’s wild, chaotic patchwork of sun showers, we’re getting a break from the rain. For the next few days, it’ll be partly sunny with highs in the low 60s. Get outside. The Big Dark starts in 13 days.

But first, the news.

**Seattle’s Best Inflatables Hit the Streets:** On Saturday, 90,000 protesters hit the streets for the No Kings march in Seattle, according to an initial estimate from the organizers. If their guess is right, this march beat the first No Kings march by 20k, and amounts to about 11 percent of the city’s population. It’s clear that Seattle doesn’t know what our answer to Portland’s protest frogs are.
