UN Secretary General António Guterres warns that humanity has failed to limit global heating to 1.5C, as targeted in the Paris climate agreement. In an exclusive interview before the Cop30 climate summit, Guterres states that overshooting this target is now "inevitable", leading to "devastating consequences" for the world. He urges an immediate change of course to mitigate the impact, despite this failure. His warning is part of a growing consensus on the urgent need for significant emissions cuts to prevent catastrophic climate changes.
