  After a lifetime of thinking about others, Alese Johnston decided to put herself first. Adventurous and irresponsible, she’s happier than she has ever been

  Alese Johnston was sitting on the couch one Sunday morning, reading the Wall Street Journal, when she came across an article by a 60-year-old writer who felt he’d become boring – always telling his friends the same stories. “I do that,” Johnston thought. “So a couple of weeks later, when I turned 70, I committed to doing 70 new things over the course of the year.”

  Johnston set up a website, [Fabulous70.com](https://fabulous70.com/). She made a spreadsheet, and started filling it with ideas. The only rule was: “It had to be something I’d never done before.” Her first “first” was to eat a nem – a type of spring roll – at a supper club where she lives in Little Rock, Arkansas.

After turning 70, Alese Johnston committed to trying 70 new things within a year. This decision was sparked by reading an article by a 60-year-old writer who felt he had become boring. Johnston established a website, Fabulous70.com, and created a spreadsheet of new activities to try. The only criterion for these activities was that they had to be things she'd never done before. Her first new experience was eating a nem, a type of spring roll, at a local supper club.
