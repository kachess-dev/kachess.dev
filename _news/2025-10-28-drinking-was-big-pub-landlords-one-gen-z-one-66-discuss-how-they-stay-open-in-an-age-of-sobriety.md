In that time, our drinking habits and the fate of our pubs have changed dramatically. After a stagnant period in the 1980s, alcohol consumption soared in the late 1990s until, by 2004 – a year termed “peak booze” by [The New Statesman](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/10/peak-booze-how-my-generation-became-uk-s-heaviest-drinkers) – Britons drank 9.5 litres of alcohol per person.
