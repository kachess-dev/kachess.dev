  Last year, more than 400 pubs closed in England and Wales, as rising costs kept customers at home and drinking rates among young people declined. Can any remain afloat? Two landlords from different generations discuss the problems and possibilities

  Thirty-eight years separate pub landlords Coby Morton, 28, who runs the Dolphin Inn in Shrewsbury, and Jason Osborne, 66, who operates four pubs across the country, including the Raven in central London. In that time, our drinking habits and the fate of our pubs have changed dramatically. After a stagnant period in the 1980s, alcohol consumption soared in the late 1990s until, by 2004 – a year termed “peak booze” by [The New Statesman](https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2015/10/peak-booze-how-my-generation-became-uk-s-heaviest-drinkers) – Britons drank 9.5 litres of alcohol per person.

  In recent years, our appetite for drinking has dwindled, especially among young people. Earlier this year, a survey carried out by Savanta found nearly half (43%) of 18-34-year-olds in Britain do not drink alcohol. This, combined with rising costs, has had a huge knock-on effect on pubs. Last year, [more than 400](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/dec/30/number-of-pubs-in-england-and-wales-falls-below-39000-for-first-time) shut their doors and in the first half of 2025, 200 more followed. Clearly, it’s a tricky time to be a pub landlord. Morton and Osborne tell us about the highs and lows of the profession today and in years past.

In the past year, over 400 pubs in England and Wales closed due to increasing costs and declining youth drinking rates. Landlords Coby Morton, 28, and Jason Osborne, 66, discuss the industry's challenges. While alcohol consumption surged in the late 1990s, it has recently waned, particularly among 18-34-year-olds, with a Savanta survey revealing that 43% do not drink alcohol. This shift, coupled with high costs, has greatly impacted pubs, leading to a significant number of closures. Both Morton and Osborne share their experiences navigating these changes in their profession.
