The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group in Sudan, has reportedly captured El Fasher, a city it has besieged for over a year amid the country's civil war. This has led to increasing concerns for the hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in the city. The RSF also claimed to have seized control of the army’s main base in Darfur, a region where a famine was declared last year in a displacement camp. The group released a statement asserting it had extended control over El Fasher, freeing it from "mercenaries and militias".
