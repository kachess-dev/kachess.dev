  \ \nHave you been told your pie-munching skills are second to none? Well, now's
  your chance to really prove it, and in front of a crowd! As yet another installment
  in what feels like a series of silly little happenings in Cal Anderson Park (remember
  the [pudding fork meetup](/seattle/events/eat-pudding-with-a-fork/e219479/)?), this
  lesbian/queer competition invites locals to celebrate community (and carbs) in the
  sweetest way possible. Bring your own pie to compete (any flavor counts, but it
  needs to be 9\") and prepare to get messy for glory and prizes. Come with a friend,
  a date, and most importantly, an appetite. **LANGSTON THOMAS**   \n_(Cal Anderson
