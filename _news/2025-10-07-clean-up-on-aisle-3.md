  I've never been to HUMP! before... can you tell me more about it?**\n\n**A:** [**HUMP!**](https://www.humpfilmfest.com/2024-part2)
  **is the world's best indie erotic film fest—it’s adult entertainment by real people
  for real people.** Every year, hot, creative, and kinky bite-sized shorts (no film
  is longer than 5 minutes) are submitted by creators from around the world, and the
  HUMP! Jury selects the best of the best to create joyful, sex-positive, and inclusive
  feature-length lineups.  \n  \n**Q: So... I'm going to watch adult films in a room
  full of strangers?**\n\n**A: These aren't your typical adult films!** HUMP! takes
  pride in celebrating all body types, shapes, ages, colors, sexualities, genders,
  kinks, and fetishes, and these insanely creative, independently-made shorts often
  redefine the adult genre. You'll see things you'd never see sitting at home, and
  you'll immediately find yourself cheering, clapping, and laughing along with the
  crowd!  \n  \nOur 20-year mission of creating a public space for sex-positivity,
  representation, and inclusivity is feeling more important than ever, but we’re up
  for the challenge and we know you are, too! And when you purchase a ticket to HUMP!,
  you’re supporting ethical content creation – filmmakers receive a percentage of
  every ticket sold, and are also eligible for up to $10,000 in audience and jury
  awards!\n\n**Dates:** Friday, October 10th & Saturday, October 11th&nbsp;\n\n**Times:**
  Two shows each night! 7 p.m. & 9:30 p.m.\n\n**Where:** At the old QFC on 15th Avenue
  East on Capitol Hill. Current home of the Punk Rock Flea Market.\n\n[Watch the trailer!](https://www.humpfilmfest.com/#falltrailer)\n\n**[Tickets
