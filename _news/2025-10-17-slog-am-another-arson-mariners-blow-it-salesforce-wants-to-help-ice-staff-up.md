  a fire</a> on a porch in Mount Baker. Crews responded and snuffed out the flames
  out before they engulfed the house. The two residents evacuated safely. This arson
  is the third in the area this year. Two fires were set in the same vicinity this
  past July. Police haven’t said if the fires are connected. No firebug(s) caught
  yet. </p>\n<p><strong>Kent Residents Not So Lucky: </strong>An apartment fire in
  Kent <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/kent/kent-apartment-fire-displaces-15-people-5-families/281-3df4e20d-11f8-4492-aedb-479a95d32175?tbref=hp\">spread</a>
  to six units and displaced 15 people. </p>\n<p><strong>I Went to the Big Game Last
  Night: </strong>T-Mobile Park was yet again bummer city as the Mariners flopped

  about 10 tons of trash</a>. The bad baseball accounts for another several tons.
  That last part is a joke. Hahaha. Sorry. I'll be positive. We'll get 'em today.
  First pitch is at 3:08 p.m.</p>\n<p><strong>Low Tow Blow: </strong>Around 45 attendees

  their cars missing</a>. The parking lot they'd opted for after the 1,900-spot park-and-ride
  garage filled up was actually private. Its owner? An asshole. He called a tow truck
  on the parked cars. Drivers say the lot didn't have any \"No Parking\" signs. The
  tow company made $18,000 in tows. Or, for you number heads, $400 per vehicle. </p>\n<p><strong>And
  Now, The Weather:</strong> It's wet this morning. That should clear up soon. Sun
  this afternoon. Rain returns Saturday. Mildness persists this fall. </p>\n<p><strong>Feds

  her</a> for allegedly interfering with an arrest outside the U.S. Immigration and
  Customs Enforcement building. Korol had been performing with band across from the
  facility playing the <em>Ghostbusters</em> theme when officers chased a man through
  the band. Charging documents accuse Korol of kicking and biting an officer. Her 
  bandmates say they didn't see anything like that. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oriana
  Korol, a clarinetist with the Unpresidented Brass Band, was arrested after a man

  Indicted: </strong>Trump's former national security advisor, John Bolton, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/john-bolton-indictment-trump.html\">was

  pages of 'diary' notes about his day-to-day activities\" working under Trump, reports
  the <em>New York Times</em>. “He’s a bad guy,” Trump told reporters about Bolton.
  “That’s the way it goes.” While Bolton is Trump’s political enemy, and Trump has
  brazenly targeted political enemies like James Comey and Letitia James with criminal
