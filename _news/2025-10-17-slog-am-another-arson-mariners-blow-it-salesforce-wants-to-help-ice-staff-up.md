original_content: "The Stranger's morning news roundup. by Nathalie Graham\n\n**Another
  Arson:** At around 1:10 a.m. Friday, someone [lit a fire](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/porch-fire-seattle-mount-baker-arson/281-7ba4bbc2-6f0f-4fa1-b2e2-e3336c59ef42?tbref=hp)
  on a porch in Mount Baker. Crews responded and snuffed out the flames out before
  they engulfed the house. The two residents evacuated safely. This arson is the third
  in the area this year. Two fires were set in the same vicinity this past July. Police
  haven’t said if the fires are connected. No firebug(s) caught yet.&nbsp;\n\n**Kent
  Residents Not So Lucky:** An apartment fire in Kent [spread](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/kent/kent-apartment-fire-displaces-15-people-5-families/281-3df4e20d-11f8-4492-aedb-479a95d32175?tbref=hp)
  to six units and displaced 15 people.&nbsp;\n\n**I Went to the Big Game Last Night:**
  T-Mobile Park was yet again bummer city as the Mariners flopped and the dreaded
  Blue Jays soared—8-2, ouch. This Reuters headline about sums it up: \"[Mariners
  fans get dose of something more familiar - disappointment](https://www.reuters.com/sports/mariners-fans-get-dose-something-more-familiar-disappointment-2025-10-17/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&taid=68f1d46441ccb1000198226a&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=bluesky).\"
  The series is tied at 2-2. All hope is not lost! Right?&nbsp;\n\n**Trash Talk:**
  At a sold-out Ms game, fans [produce about 10 tons of trash](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/climate-lab/how-much-trash-does-a-sold-out-mariners-game-produce-weve-got-the-numbers/).
  The bad baseball accounts for another several tons. That last part is a joke. Hahaha.
  Sorry. I'll be positive. We'll get 'em today. First pitch is at 3:08 p.m.\n\n**Low
  Tow Blow:** Around 45 attendees of Wednesday night's Mariners game had a rude awakening
  after they schlepped all the way north back to the Lynnwood on the light rail to
  [find their cars missing](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/drivers-towed-lynnwood-light-rail-station/281-a6c4ea40-4d17-40ef-8e6a-ed0719756392?tbref=hp).
  The parking lot they'd opted for after the 1,900-spot park-and-ride garage filled
  up was actually private. Its owner? An asshole. He called a tow truck on the parked
  cars. Drivers say the lot didn't have any \"No Parking\" signs. The tow company
  made $18,000 in tows. Or, for you number heads, $400 per vehicle.&nbsp;\n\n**And
  Now, The Weather:** It's wet this morning. That should clear up soon. Sun this afternoon.
  Rain returns Saturday. Mildness persists this fall.&nbsp;\n\n**Feds Charge Clarinetist
  with Alleged Assault:** Oriana Korol, a 38-year-old clarinetist in Portland's Unpresidented
  Brass Band, spent three nights in an Clark County Jail after federal officers [arrested
  her](https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2025/10/band-member-accused-of-interfering-with-federal-arrest-of-another-feds-allege.html)
  for allegedly interfering with an arrest outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs
  Enforcement building. Korol had been performing with band across from the facility
  playing the _Ghostbusters_ theme when officers chased a man through the band. Charging
  documents accuse Korol of kicking and biting an officer. Her&nbsp; bandmates say
  they didn't see anything like that.&nbsp;\n\n> Oriana Korol, a clarinetist with
  the Unpresidented Brass Band, was arrested after a man and federal agents barreled
  into band members who were standing across the street from the ICE office and playing
  the theme from “Ghostbusters.”&nbsp;\n> \n> Read more: www.oregonlive.com/crime/2025/1...

  is Not First Time ICE Has Lied** regarding an arrest. When ICE agents illegally
  arrested Columbia graduate and Pro-Palestine activist Mahmoud Khalil in March, ICE
  stated in a report that Khalil attempted to flee arrest. [He did not](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/new-footage-confirms-ice-lied-and-had-no-reason-to-detain-mahmoud-khalil).\n\n**Bugging
  the Sea:** Scientists put a mile of fiber optic cable into the Salish Sea around
  the San Juan Islands to [eavesdrop](https://www.kuow.org/stories/scientists-hope-underwater-fiber-optic-cables-can-help-save-endangered-orcas)
  on orca conversations. The cable can function as a kind of underwater microphone,
  a twist on the technology known as Distributed Acoustic Sensing, or DAS that is
  usually used to monitor pipelines and investigate infrastructure problems. Scientists
  have adapted it to listen in on the ocean. The hope is to pick up the orcas' clicks,
  calls, and whistles and see how they're responding to \"ship traffic, food scarcity,
  and climate change.\" It's worked with baleen whales, but scientists aren't positive
  yet that the DAS can pick up the higher-frequency orca calls.\n\n**No Kings Returns:**
  Another No Kings protest is set for Saturday Oct. 18. Around 2,500 rallies are planned
  across the country. Saturday's Seattle march [will start](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/what-to-know-as-second-no-kings-protest-hits-seattle-western-wa/)
  at Seattle Center’s International Fountain at noon followed by a march downtown.
  It should be wet. Show up. Laminate your signs.&nbsp;\n\n**Now This Is Journalism:**
  WIRED went to a meetup for the 53,000-person Facebook group Cybertruck Owners Only
  asked Tesla Cybertruck owners [how it feels to own such a politically-charged car](https://www.wired.com/story/owning-a-cybertruck/?utm_content=buffera0ad9&utm_medium=social&utm_source=bluesky&utm_campaign=aud-dev).
  The Cybertruck is Elon Musk’s 15th baby and is heavily associated with Trump's return
  to the White House. The story rocks. There's a guy who was flabbergasted that people
  consider the car political. It turns out he was arrested and charged with conspiracy
  for participating in the Jan. 6 insurrection and pardoned by Trump. After loving
  on the truck, WIRED asked one guy if there's anything he doesn't like about it and
  he said, \"I can't really see the front out of the windshield because it’s so long.\"
  There's so much.&nbsp;\n\n> This single story is worth the cost of my year's subscription

  Recommends Heroin for Pain Relief:** Reddit's chatbot, Reddit Answers, [recommended](https://www.404media.co/reddit-answers-ai-suggests-users-try-heroin/)
  users seeking pain management solutions try out heroin or kratom, an herbal extract
  the Mayo Clinic calls \"unsafe and ineffective.\" Oops!\n\n**John Bolton Indicted:**
  Trump's former national security advisor, John Bolton, [was indicted](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/politics/john-bolton-indictment-trump.html)
  by a Maryland grand jury on charges of mishandling classified information. Bolton
  allegedly used a personal email and messaging app to share \"more than 1,000 pages
  of 'diary' notes about his day-to-day activities\" working under Trump, reports
  the _New York Times_. “He’s a bad guy,” Trump told reporters about Bolton. “That’s
  the way it goes.” While Bolton is Trump’s political enemy, and Trump has brazenly
  targeted political enemies like James Comey and Letitia James with criminal investigations,
  the Bolton investigation started during the Biden administration. Bolton pleaded
  “not guilty.”&nbsp;\n\n**JB Pritzker Wins Big:** Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, who
  is an heir to the Hyatt hotel chain and worth about $3.9 billion, won $1.4 million
  in a Las Vegas blackjack game, [according to tax records](https://apnews.com/article/gambling-pritzker-las-vegas-blackjack-tax-return-692a3dfff822f70faa74281f936ddc47).
  “I was incredibly lucky,” he told reporters.\n\n**Trump Lowers IVF Prices:** Ugh,
  okay this is a good thing he did. But I'm still waiting for the other shoe to drop.
  Trump announced Thursday that employers will be allowed to offer standalone coverage
  for IVF treatments and one drug company, EMD Serono, would offer discounts on some
  of the IVF drugs. He's somewhat following through on campaign promises [to make
  IVF more affordable](https://19thnews.org/2025/10/trump-ivf-fertility-costs-insurance/),
  however he's falling far short of his assertion he would \"be mandating that the
  insurance company pay\" for the treatments.&nbsp;\n\n**ICE Arrests Chicago Police
  Officer:** ICE [arrested a cop](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/16/politics/ice-arrests-chicago-suburb-police-officer-hanover-park)
  working in the Chicago suburb of Hanover Park for overstaying a tourist visa in
  2015. He’s originally from Montenegro. The Hanover Park Police Department said they
  conducted a background check on their officer before he was hired and found he was
  lawfully allowed to work in the country. ICE not backing the blue? The thin blue
  line gets even thinner.&nbsp;\n\n**SalesForce Bends the Knee:** Hey, techies, your
  CEO is trying to make your job to staff up the Gestapo. SalesForce CEO Marc Benioff
  has come out as a fan of Trump and a proponent of sending the National Guard to
  San Francisco. Benioff has also pitched Trump on using SalesForce's AI technology
  [to meet ICE's staffing needs](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/16/us/salesforce-benioff-ice.html).
  SalesForce has previously contracted with ICE under the Obama and Biden administrations.
  But, while that's not great, the scope of what ICE is and is doing has changed drastically
  this year, veering into the stomach-roiling bad-for-humanity zone. At what point
  do you cast off your branded SalesForce Patagonia puffy jacket?&nbsp;\n\n**A Few
  Dead People:** Kiss' original lead guitarist, Ace Frehly,&nbsp;[is dead](https://apnews.com/article/ace-frehley-dead-kiss-36d8ed5073bc169bf1e14ea1dc13f30e)
  at 74. Susan Stamberg, who was the first woman to anchor a national news program
  thanks to her work at NPR, [is dead](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/16/1184880448/susan-stamberg-obituary)
  at 87. Do your mourning in the comments.\n\n**For the Bandwagoners:** I know I've
  linked this before, but I'm going to link it again. If you're suddenly into Mariners
  baseball and you want to be even more into Mariners baseball, watch this. Also,
  if they keep losing, then this will be even more of a salve:"
