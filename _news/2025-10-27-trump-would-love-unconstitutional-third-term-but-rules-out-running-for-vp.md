  “I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said, in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One while traveling from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Tokyo, Japan, on Monday, the latest leg of a five-day trip to Asia which he hopes to cap with an agreement on a [trade war truce](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/27/us-china-framework-trade-deal-xi-trump-meeting) with the Chinese president, [Xi Jinping](https://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping).

Donald Trump, on Monday, dismissed the idea of running for vice-presidency in the 2028 US elections, a unique strategy proposed by some supporters to allow him a third term in office. During a trip from Kuala Lumpur to Tokyo, Trump clarified he could pursue the vice-presidency but chose not to. The announcement was part of a five-day Asia trip aimed at forging a trade truce with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
