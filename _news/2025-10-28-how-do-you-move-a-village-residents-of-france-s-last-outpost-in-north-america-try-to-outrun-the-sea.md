The Saint-Pierre and Miquelon archipelago, an overseas collectivity of France off the Canadian coast, is facing an existential threat from rising sea levels due to climate change. The solution proposed involves relocating the historic village of Miquelon to higher ground, a move that has sparked controversy among the residents. Franck Detcheverry, Miquelon's mayor, is planning to build his new home on a hill 40 meters above the current sea level. The village, consisting of around 400 buildings, is presently situated only 2 meters above sea level.
