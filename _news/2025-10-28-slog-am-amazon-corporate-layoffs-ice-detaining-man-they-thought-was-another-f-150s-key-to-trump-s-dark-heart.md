**It Takes Big Glass Balls** to lay off 14,000 corporate employees, but that’s just what Amazon plans to do, according to an internal memo the company published online. Anonymous sources familiar with the matter told _Reuters_ the company could cut up to 30,000 employees. It’s unclear who is getting the boot first, but the corporate layoffs are likely to touch every area of the company.
