original_content: "September Saw the Highest Number of Mpox Cases Since 2022&nbsp;\n
  by Micah Yip \n\nMpox cases are on the rise in King County, and local health officials
  are urging people that are eligible—and at risk—to get vaccinated.\n\nA Wednesday
  alert from&nbsp;[Public Health Insider](https://publichealthinsider.com/2025/10/22/mpox-cases-on-the-rise-in-king-county/),
  the official blog for county’s public health agency, said 45 new cases of mpox (formerly
  called monkeypox, a wrong that took the WHO [50 years](https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2022-who-recommends-new-name-for-monkeypox-disease)
  to right) were reported in King County residents in September—the highest number
  of cases in the county in single a month since the initial 2022 outbreak.&nbsp;
  which saw as many as 200 new cases in a month. Case numbers have risen in [Chicago](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/infectious_disease/supp_info/mpox-home/mpox-dashboard.html),
  in [San Francisco](https://www.sf.gov/data--mpox-case-counts), and [New York City](https://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/mpox.page)
  as well.\n\nMpox is a viral infection that causes an often extremely painful skin
  rash, and sometimes flu-like symptoms. Fortunately, most people recover without
  treatment in two to four weeks, (there have been no recorded mpox fatalities in
  King County, according to county data, and only 20 of the 716 recorded cases since
  2022 resulted in a hospitalization) but by all accounts, it’s not a virus you want
  to suffer through if you can avoid it.\n\nAnd worse, it’s very contagious, especially
  because you can pass the virus along before you show any symptoms. Mpox is most
  commonly spread through sexual contact, but can be transmitted through close physical
  contact with another person with the infection.\n\nDr. Tim Menza, the medical director
  at the county’s public health agency and a professor at the University of Washington,
  said that recent infections include more young adults, many of whom weren’t sexually
  active or vaccinated during the 2022 outbreak. They’re now more vulnerable, becoming
  more sexually active where mpox is still present. And, due to the drop in cases
  since 2022, healthcare messaging hasn’t been as strong.\n\n“Folks who were young,
  it wasn’t a thing or something they thought they needed to pay attention to in that
  time,” Menza said. “And the fact that maybe there hasn’t been much messaging around
  it to kind of keep it in people’s brains as something important.”\n\nA decline in
  federal support for mpox vaccination and awareness is another possible factor in
  the spread, Menza said.\n\nMpox is commonly seen in cisgender men, transgender people,
  and non-binary people who have sex with men. Folks who have engaged in commercial
  or transactional sex and folks who have had skin-to-skin or other close contact
  with someone with mpox are also at higher risk. Anyone in these categories should
  get the two-dose vaccine.\n\nAccording to Public Health, the vaccine prevents most
  mpox infections. If you do contract mpox, the vaccine is highly effective at preventing
  severe cases. Just like the COVID shot, it takes about two weeks from the second
  dose for the vaccine to take full effect.\n\nTo get the mpox vaccine, contact your
  healthcare provider to see if they offer it. If you don’t have insurance or if your
  insurance doesn’t cover the full cost, you can get vaccinated for free at Public
  Health’s [Sexual Health Clinic at Harborview](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/health-centers-programs-services/public-health-centers/sexual-health-clinic),
  regardless of immigration or documentation status. You can schedule an appointment
  at 206-744-3950. Walk-ins are available.\n\nFor a full list of clinics offering
  mpox vaccines, you can visit [this page](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/health-safety/disease-illness/mpox/vaccine)

  that the spike in cases isn't due to unvaccinated young adults. That demographic
  is just at higher risk.&nbsp;_"

King County has seen a rise in Mpox cases, with 45 new cases reported in September 2025, marking the highest single-month tally since the 2022 outbreak. Mpox, a viral infection causing a painful skin rash and flu-like symptoms, can be spread through sexual or close physical contact. Recent infections include more young adults, potentially due to a decline in healthcare messaging and federal support for vaccination. Dr. Tim Menza attributes some of the rise to the younger generation who may not have been sexually active or vaccinated during the initial outbreak. Vaccination is highly encouraged, particularly for those at higher risk.
