Patients can often struggle to find affordable care during contract disputes between their insurance provider and hospital. If this situation arises, it's important to know your rights and options. Be aware of your coverage, including network restrictions, and always cross-check your insurer's provider list. Try to negotiate with your insurer or provider, or consider switching providers if necessary. If you're caught in out-of-network care without prior knowledge, appeal the decision. Finally, remember that emergency care must be covered regardless of network status. Stay proactive in managing your healthcare to ensure the best possible outcomes.
