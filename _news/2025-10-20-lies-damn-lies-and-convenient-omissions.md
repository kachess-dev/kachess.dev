original_content: "The Seattle Times Editorial Board Has Joined the Harrell Campaign
  and Thinks We Didn’t Notice\n by Marcus Harrison Green \n\nLook, if the&nbsp;_Seattle
  Times_ Editorial Board wants to sycophantically cosplay as a PR firm for Mayor Bruce
  Harrell and call it “opinion,” that’s their kink. But when the future of the city
  is on the line, we should at least expect them to deal in facts.\n\nCase in point:
  [Sunday’s most recent Harrell](https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/mayor-harrell-takes-his-message-to-the-people-wherever-whoever-they-are/)fan-fiction.
  Written by Carlton Winfrey, who serves on the paper’s editorial board, the piece
  tries to make the case that Harrell is a man of the people, eager to listen to his
  constituents, no matter who they are or how deep their pockets are. He doesn’t pack
  debates with supporters, Winfrey writes, not because he’s unpopular, but because
  he wants to hear from his dissenters. He touts an ordinary campaign stop at Pike
  Place Market as a sign he’s engaging with the public. And he points to a video he
  made with TikToker Chappin Eze, conveniently leaving out that it was part of a series
  with both candidates.\n\nAnd then there’s the section on race in the mayoral campaign.
  If you truly expected a nuanced excavation of how race, class, gender, and political
  ideology both collide and coexist in this race, well, I envy your meds. Instead,
  the piece treats race like a stage prop, dusted off just long enough to imply Katie
  Wilson’s campaign had gone full [John McCain](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/study-2008-mccain-attack-ads-darkened-obama-skin-tone/)
  circa 2008 presidential election against Barack Obama, in darkening the skin of
  her mixed race opponent. And there, the _Times_ dutifully reprints the mayor’s claims
  that a “mailer” from Common Power supporting Katie Wilson “darkened” the mayor’s
  skin, and the group’s director apologized. Cute story. Except, plot twist, none
  of that happened.\n\nFirst, it wasn’t a mailer; it was a social-media graphic. Second,
  the Canva filter in question didn’t “darken” anyone. It made both candidates slightly
  orange. Think less “Jim Crow Photoshop,” more “Trump Spice Latte.” And third, the
  Common Power director, Charles Douglas? Never apologized, at least not publicly.
  Instead, he was quoted in a press release sent out Sept. 27 by the Katie Wilson
  for an Affordable Seattle PAC (to every major outlet, maybe the _Times_’ spam filter
  has trust issues) saying:\n\n“As a Black man leading an organization primarily run
  by people of color, I know firsthand the harm caused when racial tropes are weaponized
  in politics. To suggest that Common Power engaged in such tactics is a sensationalist
  smear that reeks of desperation from a mayor who has repeatedly contributed to inequality
  and hurt the very communities he now claims to represent.”\n\nAnd just for good
  measure, to ensure that there wasn’t any doubt as to his stance, Common Power sent
  out its own press release that same day, further quoting Douglas (that again must’ve
  fallen victim to the _Times’_ overly aggressive spam filter).\n\n“We are two Black
  men who help lead an organization alongside other people of color, and we are the
  ones who created this debate watch advertisement. It made the candidates slightly
  oranger, not blacker. That’s the way fun filters are used on Instagram,” Douglas
  said. “Common Power is not a pawn to be used to divide and conquer the Seattle community.
  We immediately removed the filter from both candidates’ pictures on our posting
  once we received notice of objections. We're disappointed in the Harrell campaign's
  rushed accusation, as this matter could have easily been solved through basic communications.
  Good-faith leadership is needed today in America, more than ever.”\n\nNothing screams
  “independent press” like conveniently omitting statements that were sent out nearly
  a month ago. If this were the national press&nbsp;mindlessly regurgitating a sitting
  elected official's talking points, people would be foaming at the mouth, and rightfully
  so. So why should we stomach the same lazy propaganda from the editorial board of
  the biggest paper in our own backyard?\n\nNow, I’m not here to tell anyone how to
  do their job, but maybe, just maybe, if the _Times_ had picked up the phone instead
  of their glazing machine, they might’ve noticed the mayor’s claims were verifiably
  false, and that this was a manufactured crisis. But who needs truth when you’ve
  got narrative control, and that narrative favorably fluffs the guy you think should
  be mayor."

Marcus Harrison Green criticizes the Seattle Times Editorial Board for their biased support of Mayor Bruce Harrell. Green suggests the board is overlooking facts and misrepresenting events to favor Harrell. He points out an incident where they inaccurately reported Harrell's claims that a social media graphic, created by Common Power, had "darkened" his skin. Green states that the filter used made both candidates slightly orange, not darker, and that the board ignored statements from Common Power's director, Charles Douglas, refuting Harrell's claims. Green calls for better journalistic integrity from the Seattle Times Editorial Board.
