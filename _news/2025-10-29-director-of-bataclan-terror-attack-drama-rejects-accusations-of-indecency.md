**Jean-Xavier de Lestrade**, the Oscar-winning director of a TV mini-series about the 2015 Bataclan terrorist attack in Paris, has defended his decision to film inside the theatre. His choice was criticized as "indecent", given that 130 people died in the attack. De Lestrade argued that the survivors, who are the basis of the eight-part docudrama, wanted their harrowing experience recreated within the actual location. Shooting elsewhere, he said, would have constituted a "trickery".
