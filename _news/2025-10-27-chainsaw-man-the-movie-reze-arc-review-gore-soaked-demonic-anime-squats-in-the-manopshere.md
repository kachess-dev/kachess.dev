Tatsuki Fujimoto’s coming-of-age saga continues with a surreal encounter with a chainsaw-wielding demon living in a teenager’s soul

Shortly after last month’s [Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/08/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-infinity-castle-review-anime-series) – confirmed last weekend as the highest-grossing anime feature of all time – a big-screen outing for a movie adaptation of what, in manga terms, is a relative upstart: Tatsuki Fujimoto’s gore-soaked coming-of-age saga, first serialised in 2018.
