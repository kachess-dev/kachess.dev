Zach and Luna, a couple living with their elderly grandparents, navigate the challenges of maintaining their sex life in a multi-generational home. This arrangement, although financially beneficial, comes with its own difficulties, particularly concerning privacy. The couple has found creative ways to express their intimacy, like Luna wearing fluffy cat ears and crawling under Zach's desk while he works on his thesis. Despite the occasional awkward moments, such as their grandmother overhearing them, they manage to keep their relationship lively and intimate.
