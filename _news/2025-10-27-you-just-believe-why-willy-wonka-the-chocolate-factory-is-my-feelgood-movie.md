  hat play the flute to summon a jodhpur-wearing Oompa-Loompa. Luckily, Willy Wonka
  &amp; the Chocolate Factory has plenty of that and a lot more besides. I don’t care
  if you’ve just received a terminal diagnosis or found out your wife’s been having
  an affair with Chris Martin, you stick this film on and you’ll smile.</p><p>The
  last time I watched it, before rewatching for this article, was with my wife and
  infant son in the week after his birth. He was too busy crapping himself to understand
  what was going on so the film was obviously just for us. Why would two thirtysomethings
  choose to watch a children’s film from the 1970s? Perhaps we were nostalgic for
  our own lost childhoods of watching it every Christmas and bank holiday, perhaps
  we were excited for the near future of a new childhood, or perhaps because this
  is a film where a man eats a microphone instead of answering a reporter’s question.
  No hands. Just eats it and goes back to his meal like it was nothing. Silly, odd
  and utterly joyous. And the silliest, oddest and most joyous thing of all is Wonka
  himself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/oct/27/willy-wonka-feelgood-movie">Continue
