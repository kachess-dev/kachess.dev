  Nathalie Graham\n          \n          \n          \n            <p><strong>Airline
  of the Year: </strong>Alaska Airlines <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/alaska-airlines-tech-outage-grounds-flights/281-74e6f6f7-0dac-4c2a-8bf1-fbcebaae29ef?tbref=hp\">experienced</a>
  a tech outage on Thursday that grounded flights for seven hours. The outage cancelled
  229 flights and caused hundreds of delays, but was resolved as of 11:30 p.m. on
  Thursday. Delays still lingered into Friday morning, though everything seemed back
  up and running again. Our digital world is so tenuous. The Amazon Web Services outage
  earlier this week lasted more than two hours and sent banks offline, stifled WhatsApp
  conversations, and even forced people with internet-connected temperature-regulated
  smart beds <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/business/amazon-aws-outage-eight-sleep-mattress.html\">to
  sleep on boiling mattresses</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Soggy South Seattle School: </strong>Emerson
  Elementary in Rainier Beach closed Thursday after a broken water fountain flooded
  the second floor. The school <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/emerson-elementary-in-south-seattle-closed-due-to-flooding/\">remains
  closed</a> Friday and will be closed Monday, too. Since the school is a Title 1
  school and district funding is tight, they need all the help they can get. <a href=\"https://www.givebacks.com/causes/wspta-00023295/campaigns/ef4193239886e0\">Consider
  donating to the fundraiser</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>Bullfrog Road Croaks: </strong>The
  I-90 overpass at exit 80 near Cle Elum <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/bullfrog-road-overpass-on-i-90-hit-by-oversized-load-to-be-demolished/\">was
  gutted</a> by an oversized load. A too-tall truck without the right permits ripped
  up the Bullfrog Road overpass's belly. Now, it's slated for demolition. Gov. Bob
  Ferguson issued an emergency proclamation about the closed overpass in order to
  receive federal funds for the repair which will cost more than $8 million. </p>\n
  \           <p><strong>The Weather: </strong>Where is this \"roller coaster\" of
  weather we were promised? Oh, it should be here soon. Heavy rain and wind should
  start buffeting us Friday. Things will pick up even more on Saturday. Cozy, stormy
  weekend here we come. Who has a good soup recipe? <a href=\"mailto:ngraham@thestranger.com\">Email
  it to me</a>, the comment section is too scary. </p>\n<p><strong>A Wet, Wet, Winter
  Ahead:</strong> Due to a marine heatwave over the Pacific Ocean coined \"the blob\"
  by a University of Washington scientist, the Pacific Northwest could be in for <a
  href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/pacific-ocean-marine-heatwave-north-west\">an
  extra soggy winter</a> this year.</p>\n<p><strong>RIP Sun: </strong>The last 6 p.m.
  sunset of the year will come on Sunday Oct. 26. Hello, darkness. </p>\n<p><strong>Firebugs
  Wanted: </strong>Seattle authorities <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/string-of-arsons-hits-central-district-south-seattle-police-say/\">are
  searching</a> for suspected arsonists connected to six intentionally-set fires in
  South Seattle between Oct. 17 and Oct. 22. If you know anything call 800-552-7766
  or email SFD_FIU@seattle.gov. The Arson Alarm Foundation is offering a reward for
  any information on the suspects. </p>\n<p><strong>Bus Lane Avengers Just Dropped: </strong>Following
  her successful advocacy that led to the reinstatement of a bus-only lane on 12th
  Avenue and Union Street, Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck announced the \"<a
  href=\"https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/10/23/rinck-launches-better-bus-lanes-campaign-with-transit-advocates/\">Better
  Bus Lanes\" campaign</a>. Together with a slew of transportation advocates and advocacy
  groups, Rinck said she'll push to save and prioritize other bus lanes around the
  city, specifically upgrading Aurora Avenue N, Denny Way, and Rainier Avenue S. Bus
  lane avengers, assemble!</p>\n<p><strong>Ex-Microsoft Exec in the Epstein Files: </strong>Former
  Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Nathan Myhrvold penned a birthday wish to sex
  trafficker and New York financier Jeffrey Epstein in his 2003 birthday book. Myhrvold's
  name also appears in the flight log for two private jet trips in the 1990s. So far,
  Myhrvold says he knew Epstein, but the two were just acquaintances. The newly uncovered
  information seems to prove otherwise. “Mr. Myhrvold knew him from TED conferences
  and as a donor to basic scientific research,” the spokesperson <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/ex-microsoft-exec-nathan-myhrvold-named-in-epstein-flight-logs/\">told
  the <em>Seattle Times</em></a>. “He regrets that he ever met him.”</p>\n<p><strong>Well,
  the White House Looks Great: </strong>In very heavy-handed metaphor, President Donald
  Trump has taken a literal wrecking ball to American history and legacy. To make
  way for his new, big ballroom, the White House's East Wing <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5570860-trump-white-house-ballroom-east-wing-takeaways/\">is
  now rubble</a>.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The East Wing is totally gone.

  on a Truth Social tirade</a> after witnessing a Canadian TV ad opposing US tariffs.
  Trump called the ad “egregious behavior.\" The ad apparently featured a clip of

  Inflates: </strong>Inflation rates <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/24/business/cpi-inflation-tariffs-fed\">increased</a>
  only slightly in September due to rising costs from tariffs. The Consumer Price
  Index, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics released 10 days late, shows an increase
  of 3 percent compared to this time last year. Due to the government shutdown, the
  White House said October's inflation report likely won't be released. </p>\n<p><strong>AI
  Is so Dumb:</strong> Last year, Baltimore county high schools implemented an AI
  system that uses footage from school cameras to detect potential weapons. On Monday,
  the AI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/baltimore-student-ai-gun-detection-system-doritos?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">alerted</a>
  police that a student at a Baltimore high school had a gun. Police arrived, put
  the teenager in handcuffs, and searched him. He didn't have a gun. The AI thought
  the Dorito bag he'd been eating out of and holding with two hands and one finger
  out looked like a gun. </p>\n<p><strong>All Publicity Is Good Publicity:</strong>

  Louvre Heist, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/louvre-heist-lift-maker-scli-intl\">is
  using the heist</a> in its promotional materials now. In an <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/boeckermaschinenwerke/p/DQBr9Xdgp_D/\">Instagram
