original_content: "The Stranger's morning news roundup. by Nathalie Graham\n\n**Airline
  of the Year:&nbsp;** Alaska Airlines [experienced](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/alaska-airlines-tech-outage-grounds-flights/281-74e6f6f7-0dac-4c2a-8bf1-fbcebaae29ef?tbref=hp)
  a tech outage on Thursday that grounded flights for seven hours. The outage cancelled
  229 flights and caused hundreds of delays, but was resolved as of 11:30 p.m. on
  Thursday. Delays still lingered into Friday morning, though everything seemed back
  up and running again. Our digital world is so tenuous. The Amazon Web Services outage
  earlier this week lasted more than two hours and sent banks offline, stifled WhatsApp
  conversations, and even forced people with internet-connected temperature-regulated
  smart beds&nbsp;[to sleep on boiling mattresses](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/business/amazon-aws-outage-eight-sleep-mattress.html).&nbsp;\n\n**Soggy
  South Seattle School:** Emerson Elementary in Rainier Beach closed Thursday after
  a broken water fountain flooded the second floor. The school [remains closed](https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/emerson-elementary-in-south-seattle-closed-due-to-flooding/)
  Friday and will be closed Monday, too. Since the school is a Title 1 school and
  district funding is tight, they need all the help they can get. [Consider donating
  to the fundraiser](https://www.givebacks.com/causes/wspta-00023295/campaigns/ef4193239886e0).&nbsp;\n\n**Bullfrog
  Road Croaks:** The I-90 overpass at exit 80 near Cle Elum [was gutted](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/transportation/bullfrog-road-overpass-on-i-90-hit-by-oversized-load-to-be-demolished/)
  by an oversized load. A too-tall truck without the right permits ripped up the Bullfrog
  Road overpass's belly. Now, it's slated for demolition. Gov. Bob Ferguson issued
  an emergency proclamation about the closed overpass in order to receive federal
  funds for the repair which will cost more than $8 million.&nbsp;\n\n**The Weather:&nbsp;**
  Where is this \"roller coaster\" of weather we were promised? Oh, it should be here
  soon. Heavy rain and wind should start buffeting us Friday. Things will pick up
  even more on Saturday. Cozy, stormy weekend here we come. Who has a good soup recipe?
  [Email it to me](mailto:ngraham@thestranger.com), the comment section is too scary.&nbsp;\n\n**A
  Wet, Wet, Winter Ahead:** Due to a marine heatwave over the Pacific Ocean coined
  \"the blob\" by a University of Washington scientist, the Pacific Northwest could
  be in for [an extra soggy winter](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/pacific-ocean-marine-heatwave-north-west)
  this year.\n\n**RIP Sun:&nbsp;** The last 6 p.m. sunset of the year will come on
  Sunday Oct. 26. Hello, darkness.&nbsp;\n\n**Firebugs Wanted:&nbsp;** Seattle authorities
  [are searching](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/string-of-arsons-hits-central-district-south-seattle-police-say/)
  for suspected arsonists connected to six intentionally-set fires in South Seattle
  between Oct. 17 and Oct. 22. If you know anything call 800-552-7766 or email SFD\\_FIU@seattle.gov.
  The Arson Alarm Foundation is offering a reward for any information on the suspects.&nbsp;\n\n**Bus
  Lane Avengers Just Dropped:&nbsp;** Following her successful advocacy that led to
  the reinstatement of a bus-only lane on 12th Avenue and Union Street, Councilmember
  Alexis Mercedes Rinck announced the \"[Better Bus Lanes\" campaign](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/10/23/rinck-launches-better-bus-lanes-campaign-with-transit-advocates/).
  Together with a slew of transportation advocates and advocacy groups, Rinck said
  she'll push to save and prioritize other bus lanes around the city, specifically
  upgrading Aurora Avenue N, Denny Way, and Rainier Avenue S. Bus lane avengers, assemble!\n\n**Ex-Microsoft
  Exec in the Epstein Files:&nbsp;** Former Microsoft Chief Technology Officer Nathan
  Myhrvold penned a birthday wish to sex trafficker and New York financier Jeffrey
  Epstein in his 2003 birthday book. Myhrvold's name also appears in the flight log
  for two private jet trips in the 1990s. So far, Myhrvold says he knew Epstein, but
  the two were just acquaintances. The newly uncovered information seems to prove
  otherwise. “Mr. Myhrvold knew him from TED conferences and as a donor to basic scientific
  research,” the spokesperson [told the _Seattle Times_](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/ex-microsoft-exec-nathan-myhrvold-named-in-epstein-flight-logs/).
  “He regrets that he ever met him.”\n\n**Well, the White House Looks Great:&nbsp;**
  In very heavy-handed metaphor, President Donald Trump has taken a literal wrecking
  ball to American history and legacy. To make way for his new, big ballroom, the
  White House's East Wing [is now rubble](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5570860-trump-white-house-ballroom-east-wing-takeaways/).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>

  Cancels Trade Talks with Canada&nbsp;** because of a television ad. Trump [went
  on a Truth Social tirade](https://apnews.com/article/trump-canada-trade-tariffs-a0cfd202ef6f22052827b784be708fd6)
  after witnessing a Canadian TV ad opposing US tariffs. Trump called the ad “egregious
  behavior.\" The ad apparently featured a clip of Ronald Reagan speaking negatively
  about tariffs. Trump called it fraudulent. He also said the ad was an attempt by
  Canada to influence the Supreme Court in its upcoming decision about the legality
  around some of Trump's tariffs.&nbsp;\n\n**Inflation Inflates:&nbsp;** Inflation
  rates [increased](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/24/business/cpi-inflation-tariffs-fed)
  only slightly in September due to rising costs from tariffs. The Consumer Price
  Index, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics released 10 days late, shows an increase
  of 3 percent compared to this time last year. Due to the government shutdown, the
  White House said October's inflation report likely won't be released.&nbsp;\n\n**AI
  Is so Dumb:** Last year, Baltimore county high schools implemented an AI system
  that uses footage from school cameras to detect potential weapons. On Monday, the
  AI [alerted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/24/baltimore-student-ai-gun-detection-system-doritos?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other)
  police that a student at a Baltimore high school had a gun. Police arrived, put
  the teenager in handcuffs, and searched him. He didn't have a gun. The AI thought
  the Dorito bag he'd been eating out of and holding with two hands and one finger
  out looked like a gun.&nbsp;\n\n**All Publicity Is Good Publicity:** The German
  company Böcker, which manufactured the ladder truck used in last weekend's Louvre
  Heist, [is using the heist](https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/24/europe/louvre-heist-lift-maker-scli-intl)
  in its promotional materials now. In an&nbsp;[Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/boeckermaschinenwerke/p/DQBr9Xdgp_D/),
  Böcker included a picture of its truck outside the Louvre with the caption: \"The
  next time you need things to move quickly. The Böcker Agilo transports your treasures
  weighing up to 400kg at 42 meters per minute – whisper-quiet thanks to 230 V E-motor.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>
  The German company that makes the mechanical ladder used in the Louvre heist has
  used the image to advertise, with the text 'When you need to move fast'&nbsp;\n>

  Sports Betting Scandal:&nbsp;** On Thursday, Portland Trailblazers coach Chauncey
  Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier [were arrested](https://apnews.com/article/miami-heat-terry-rozier-gambling-probe-de98ecb76bb8f13b85f4c5ac62f66221)
  in connection with two different sports gambling schemes. One scheme was a rigged
  poker game where players could compete against Billups and other former basketball
  players. Those games used high-tech cheating like \"altered card-shuffling machines,
  hidden cameras in poker chip trays, special sunglasses and even X-ray equipment
  built into the table to read cards,\" according to the&nbsp;_Associated Press_.
  High-power mafia families allegedly profited off those games, too. The other scheme
  involved players manipulating prop bets. Rozier allegedly planned to leave a game
  early and told people about it, prompting them to place bets about his worse-than-usual
  stats for that game. Thirty other people were arrested in connection with these
  schemes.&nbsp;\n\n**Good News for Teeth-Havers:&nbsp;** Scientists [are trying to
  regrow teeth](https://www.cnn.com/science/lab-grown-human-teeth-spc). They aren't
  close—they're still using a blend of human and mouth cells—but they're also not
  at square one. Maybe one day we can all grow new teeth instead of needing implants
  or crowns. Though, judging from how things function in this country, I doubt the
  process would be covered by insurance.&nbsp;\n\n**A Song for Your Friday:&nbsp;**
  This will be me all weekend.&nbsp;"
