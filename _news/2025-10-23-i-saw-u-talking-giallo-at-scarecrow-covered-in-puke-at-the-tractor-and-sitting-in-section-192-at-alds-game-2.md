  **Murakami Recs on the Train**

  We had matching boots and pants and a matching taste in Murakami. You were also very cute. Want to chat more?

  **Masked cutie at Scarecrow**

  10/15 around 4pm. We talked about Giallo and the Psychotronic bingo challenge. Talk more about movies together?

  **McDonald’s Edgar Bat @ Tractor**

  Saw you at the Mariners watch party, hanging on to your lucky bat with vomit in your lap. I love a man who can’t hold his liquor.

  **Girly pop at the UW vs Rutgers Tailgate**

  I felt so out of place as a gay man surrounded by straights. You saw me, we locked eyes and then you played the gayest music. I felt seen. Thank u \<33

  **Two super cool women who I met in an alleyway**

  We yapped away outside the party, I forgot to ask for y'alls info. I had a less cool septum ring and leather jacket. Let's be friends!

  **The chill in the air really made you standout.**

  Wow, 3rd and Madison northbound bus stop you walked by looking a bit chilly with no shirt, hope you didn’t get a chest cold. Thanks for the look back.

  **Sparks at ALDS game 2**

  We were vibing in center field bleachers sec. 192! I regret not getting your name after such a great game. You were so cute and funny.

  **Shadow Play 09/27/2025 Saturday**

  You had what appeared to be Back Cat logo yellow pants, I was wearing black, lets to get coffee?
