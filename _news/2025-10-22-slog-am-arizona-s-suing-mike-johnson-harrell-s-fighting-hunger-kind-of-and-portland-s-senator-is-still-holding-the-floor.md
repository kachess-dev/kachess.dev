  at it this morning</a>. He said, \"President Trump wants us to believe that Portland,

  that there are riots, he can say there's a rebellion. And if there's a rebellion,
  he can use that to strengthen his authoritarian grip on our nation.\" He then praised
  Portlanders for not “taking the bait” and instead demonstrating with “joy and whimsy.”

  has not</a> sworn in Adelita Grijalva, the Congresswoman who won the election in
  Arizona about a month ago. He keeps making excuses and sometimes even flat-out lies
  about why he’s not swearing her in. Arizona’s AG has had enough of Johnson’s dick
  behavior, so she’s suing him and the House. Why’s Johnson putting it off? Several
  outlets speculate that it could be because a petition to release the Epstein files
  needs just one more signature, and Grijalva has said she’ll sign it.</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking

  told them Trump was considering <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2025/10/20/donald-trump-diddy-commutation-soon/\">pardoning
  Diddy</a>, but the White House has denied it. TMZ stands by its story.</p>\n<p><strong>Coe’s
  Moving Again</strong>: If you went to last night’s live taping of <em>My Favorite

  South Hill rapist Kevin Coe. Despite being sentenced to life (multiple times, actually!)
  and being “retained indefinitely” as a sexually violent predator under Washington’s
  Community Protection Act, Coe was released earlier this month due to his “deteriorating
  health” <a href=\"https://www.krem.com/article/news/local/court-expected-grant-release-south-hill-rapist-kevin-coe/293-2e94f462-de10-40e7-ba44-a03ea517bb59\">including</a>
  severe depression, stroke, heart disease, and loss of mobility that required a walker.
  He was initially released to a home in Federal Way, but (shocking) they didn’t want
  him, so the State relocated him to Auburn, but the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe kicked
  him out, too. He’s<a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/south-hill-rapist-kevin-coe-kicked-off-muckleshoot-tribal-land/\">
  back in Federal Way</a> for now.</p>\n<p><strong>Harrell’s Scrambling to Appear
  Nice</strong>: On Monday, Mayor Harrell signed an executive order to fight food
  deserts and “ensure our children, older adults, people with mobility issues, and
  families have equitable access to fresh, local, affordable, and culturally relevant
  food and medicine.” The plan includes $12 million of food-related investments in
  next year’s budget. Sounds decent, right? Of course it does. The election is less
  than two weeks away. Just keep in mind that in July, <a href=\"https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/expensive-price-tag-seattle-approves-tougher-penalties-graffiti/SIHNYPJCCZCWBEIQFJMIRWTG4A/\">KIRO
  7 reported</a> that the city spends an estimated $6 million on graffiti clean-up.
  That money could help a lot of people! If only Harrell wasn’t afraid of a <a href=\"https://www.thestranger.com/art-and-performance-fall-2024/2024/09/19/79700841/have-you-seen-this-dog\">friendly
