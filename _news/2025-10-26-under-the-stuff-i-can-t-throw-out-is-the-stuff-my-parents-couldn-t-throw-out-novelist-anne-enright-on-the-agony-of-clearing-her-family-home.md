  the garage and look at some marks I made on the wall sometime towards the end of
  my childhood. I had discovered some tins of black and white gloss paint left on
  the floor and a narrow house-painting brush and I still remember, once the first
  dab lengthened into a line, how quickly I was lost in the pleasure of making another
  line and then another. I drew a woman in a long dress, maybe a kimono, with a wide
  belt or obi, and her hair dressed high. And when she was done, I stopped.</p><p>I

  my father’s domain and it seemed he wasn’t bothered by my daub on the wall, though
  he might have been bothered by the spoiling of a brush. He might have said, “What
  did you do that for?” which would have been enough to stop me doing more, but there
  were no serious repercussions that I can remember for my afternoon’s idle graffito.</p>

Would saying goodbye to every last newspaper clipping, button and book her parents had saved over decades help her mourn?

In the autumn of 2023, I wanted to return to the house where I was raised in order to stand in the garage and look at some marks I made on the wall sometime towards the end of my childhood.
