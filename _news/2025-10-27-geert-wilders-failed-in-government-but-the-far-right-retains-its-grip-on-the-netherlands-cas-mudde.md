  A media in thrall to Wilders’ party ensures its agenda is entrenched in Dutch politics and will dominate Wednesday’s election

  On Wednesday Dutch people go to the ballot box … again! This will be the ninth election for the _Tweede Kamer_ (second chamber), the Dutch parliament’s legislative chamber, in this still young century. In some ways the Netherlands has become the Italy of the 21st century, plagued by political fragmentation, governmental instability, and radicalisation (accompanied, increasingly often, [by violence](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/09/22/the-hague-rocked-by-far-right-protest-an-unprecedented-outburst-of-violence-in-the-netherlands_6745631_4.html)).

  This election is a direct result of this fragmentation and instability.

The Dutch elections are again in focus due to the instability and fragmentation of the political landscape, likening the situation to Italy's. The far-right Freedom Party (PVV), led by Geert Wilders, which had a significant influence on the last ruling coalition, triggered a government collapse after less than a year. The Dutch media, political parties, and voters have drawn lessons from this experience that could be relevant to other European countries grappling with the rise of far-right ideologies and their political success.
