"The Eleventh Hour" is a collection of stories by Salman Rushdie, which explores recurring themes of death and loss. These themes, present in his previous works like his 2024 book "Knife", are said to be echoes of the novelist at his peak. Despite the tragedy and violence that has touched Rushdie's life, he maintains that his books are a journey of their own, separate from his personal experiences. The stories range from an afterlife fantasy to a tale of loss in Mumbai, providing a haunting end to Rushdie's groundbreaking literary career.
