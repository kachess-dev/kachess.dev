_Dear Coffee Shops,_

_I’m boycotting you._

_Not because I don’t love you (I do). Not because I don’t want to support local business (I really do). But because I am tired of being price-gouged over a splash of non-dairy milk._

_Seventy-five cents. A dollar fifty. One place even charged me $1.75 to not get a stomachache._

_Milk isn’t kind to many of us. And yet, those of us with bodies that revolt against lactose—or who simply prefer plant-based options—are apparently expected to pay extra for the privilege of not suffering later._

_Here’s the thing: I see that oat milk you're using, barista friend. I recognize that Costco-sized box behind the counter, because I buy it too. And I know it costs around $12 for eight quarts. So let’s do the math: if you’re only using about three ounces per drink… you’re not just covering costs. You’re profiting off my fragile stomach._

_And it’s not a good look._

_If coffee shops can proudly wave flags for sustainability and inclusion, surely they can extend that same ethos to people who can’t process cow’s milk. Charge fairly. Price it in. Treat it as part of doing business in 2025, not a luxury upcharge for the weak of gut._

_Until then, I’ll be making my own lattes at home—where the oat milk is plentiful._

_Sincerely,_

_The Oat Milk Avenger_
