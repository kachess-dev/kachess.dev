It should perhaps come as no surprise that the highly anticipated horror adventure sequel Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 has fallen short of expectations. Released this week [to mixed reviews](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/21/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review-the-chinese-room-paradox-interactive), it had a tortured gestation, arriving after seven years in development via two different studios.
