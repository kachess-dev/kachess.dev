  In this week’s newsletter: It used to be OK for games like Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 to be just, well, _OK_ – but today’s boom and bust economy has almost erased an important genre

You can flirt with exotic bloodsuckers, you can psychically lob sledgehammers at bad guys; my son particularly enjoys making people explode by cursing their blood and then throwing stuff at them.
