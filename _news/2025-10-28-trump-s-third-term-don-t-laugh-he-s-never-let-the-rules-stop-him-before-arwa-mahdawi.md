  He has floated the idea more than once – and his inner circle is already gaming it out. The US constitution might say no, but Trump has a habit of finding his way around even the biggest obstacles

  Let me tell you a secret about the US constitution: it’s just a piece of paper_._ It’s not immutable law created by a higher being. It was made by men, it’s been amended by men, and it can be destroyed by men. It’s only as strong as the institutions that uphold it – institutions which Donald Trump has been [systematically weakening](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/08/us-democratic-backsliding-in-comparative-perspective?lang=en) as he expands his [executive power](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/06/trump-expansion-of-presidential-powers).

  I say this because there are still lots of people who have faith that the constitution can stop the US from gradually turning into an [electoral autocracy](https://apnews.com/article/trump-orban-hungary-autocracy-authoritarian-republicans-dfdf6299a614ec4e364be37c1132e446) like Hungary. There are still people so drunk on [American exceptionalism](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/2017/02/28/a-brief-history-of-american-exceptionalism/) that they think it’s ludicrous to believe Trump might seek a third term, because such a move is explicitly outlawed by the 22nd amendment of the constitution.

Former President Donald Trump has reportedly been considering a potential third term, despite the U.S. Constitution's 22nd amendment clearly prohibiting this. Critics argue that the U.S. Constitution is only as strong as the institutions upholding it, which they believe Trump has been systematically weakening in his bid to expand executive power. This has led to fears that the U.S. could transform into an electoral autocracy similar to Hungary, despite some people's faith in the Constitution and American exceptionalism as protective measures. Trump's inner circle is said to be already strategizing potential ways around this constitutional hurdle.
