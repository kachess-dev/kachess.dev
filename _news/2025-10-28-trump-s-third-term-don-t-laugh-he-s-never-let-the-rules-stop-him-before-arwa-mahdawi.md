He has floated the idea more than once – and his inner circle is already gaming it out. The US constitution might say no, but Trump has a habit of finding his way around even the biggest obstacles

Let me tell you a secret about the US constitution: it’s just a piece of paper_._ It’s not immutable law created by a higher being. It was made by men, it’s been amended by men, and it can be destroyed by men. It’s only as strong as the institutions that uphold it – institutions which Donald Trump has been [systematically weakening](https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2025/08/us-democratic-backsliding-in-comparative-perspective?lang=en) as he expands his [executive power](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/06/trump-expansion-of-presidential-powers).

I say this because there are still lots of people who have faith that the constitution can stop the US from gradually turning into an [electoral autocracy](https://apnews.com/article/trump-orban-hungary-autocracy-authoritarian-republicans-dfdf6299a614ec4e364be37c1132e446) like Hungary. There are still people so drunk on [American exceptionalism](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/2017/02/28/a-brief-history-of-american-exceptionalism/) that they think it’s ludicrous to believe Trump might seek a third term, because such a move is explicitly outlawed by the 22nd amendment of the constitution.
