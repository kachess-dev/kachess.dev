The article discusses the Cedar Falls disaster of 1922 in the Snoqualmie Valley. In May 1922, Seattle and the Snoqualmie Valley experienced an early summer, which led to a significant forest fire in the watershed area. The Seattle Times had encouraged city dwellers to visit the countryside, unknowingly resulting in the fire due to negligent campfire management. The disaster resulted in extensive environmental damage. The article serves as a reminder of the importance of fire safety, especially in vulnerable natural areas.
