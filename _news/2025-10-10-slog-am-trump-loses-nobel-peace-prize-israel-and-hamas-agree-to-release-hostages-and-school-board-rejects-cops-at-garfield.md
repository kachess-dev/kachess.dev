original_content: "The Stranger's Morning News Roundup.\n          \n            by
  Megan Seling\n          \n          \n          \n            <p><strong>Welcome
  to Day 10 of the 2025 Government Shutdown</strong>: Yesterday, despite the shutdown,
  <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/senate-passes-bipartisan-925-billion-defense-policy-bill.html\">the
  senate passed</a> the $925 billion national defense bill, which allows everything
  from new submarines and fighter jets to an annual pay increase for troops. That
  said, because of the shutdown, members of the military <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/10/congress/timely-troop-pay-is-now-in-trumps-hands-00601881\">may
  not get their paychecks</a>—for the first time in the history of America—come October
  15.</p>\n<p><strong>Trump Did Not Win the Nobel Peace Prize</strong>: Hahahahahahahahaha!
  He wanted it so badly, too. Loser.</p>\n<p><strong>María Corina Machado Wins Nobel
  Peace Prize</strong>: She is an opposition leader in Venezuela who lost the 2024
  election to President Nicolás Maduro. The prize committee <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maria-corina-machado-nobel-peace-prize-venezuela.html\">praised
  her</a> for “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela
  and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship
  to democracy.” Kind of the opposite vibes of ol’ Trumpty Dumpty’s vibes! Sorry,
  Don!</p>\n            <p><strong>Ceasefire in Effect</strong>: Israel and Hamas
  have <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hostages-trump-peace-plan-e3d0ce091be56cc29207e566ff1603af\">agreed
  to a ceasefire</a> in Gaza. Now both sides have <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqx7ygq41o\">72
  hours</a> to make good on their side of the deal—Hamas will release the 20 remaining
  Israeli hostages and Israel will release “around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700
  detainees from Gaza.” The BBC also reports that “about 600 humanitarian aid trucks
  are expected to enter Gaza daily.” Read Trump’s full <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70155nked7o\">20-point
  Gaza peace plan here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Seattle School Board Rejects Cops at Garfield</strong>:
  The plan, supported by Mayor Harrell, would’ve placed a uniformed SPD officer on
  Garflied’s campus, but Capitol Hill Seattle <a href=\"https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2025/10/seattle-public-schools-rejects-plan-supported-by-mayor-and-police-chief-that-would-have-stationed-cop-at-garfield-high-school/%23more-2067292710\">reports</a>
  that the school board had “concerns over disproportionate policing and the district’s
  failure to implement community recommendations in its proposal.”</p>\n<p><strong>Trump
  Cannot Send the National Guard to Chicago</strong>: Yesterday, a US district judge
  <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/09/trump-national-guard-troops-chicago-ruling\">ruled
  </a>that the Trump administration cannot “federalize or deploy” the national guard
  to Illinois for two weeks because she had “seen no credible evidence that there
  is a danger of a rebellion in the state of Illinois.” The Trump administration will
  likely appeal.</p>\n<p><strong>And! The National Guard Can’t Fuck with Protestors
  in Chicago, Either</strong>: A federal judge in Chicago also <a href=\"https://www.nprillinois.org/chicago-il/2025-10-09/judge-grants-restraining-order-protecting-protesters-journalists-in-chicago-area-protests\">granted
  a temporary restraining order</a> yesterday, blocking federal agencies from interfering
  with protestors and any journalists covering those protests. They can’t arrest or
  use physical force against journalists and they can’t use “riot control” weapons
  including tear gas and other “less-lethal” weapons and ammunition against protestors.</p>\n<p><strong>Oregon
  Might Not Be So Lucky</strong>: Yesterday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals began
  considering whether or not the Trump administration is allowed to deploy the national
  guard to “war ravaged” Portland. The 9th Circuit Court ruled on Saturday that they
  could <em>not</em> be deployed, but the Trump administration appealed the ruling
  and now the appeals court is being a butt about it. Judge Ryan Nelson, one of three
  judges on the panel (and a Trump-appointee) doesn’t really <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/10/09/oregon-national-guard-ninth-circuit-trump\">see
  a problem with it</a>. “What I'm struggling with is, the president gets to direct
  his resources as he deems fit, and it just seems a little counterintuitive to me
  that the city of Portland can come in and say 'No. You need to do it differently,'\"
  he said. EXCEPT FOR THAT TRUMP IS LYING??? There’s no war-torn city! There is no
  insurrection! Trump and his fascist bootlickers are trying to supress freedom of
  speech and the right to assemble because they want to shut up the people who are
  protesting his administration’s <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/09/milwaukie-man-ice-arrest/\">ILLEGAL

**Welcome to Day 10 of the 2025 Government Shutdown** : Yesterday, despite the shutdown, [the senate passed](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/senate-passes-bipartisan-925-billion-defense-policy-bill.html) the $925 billion national defense bill, which allows everything from new submarines and fighter jets to an annual pay increase for troops.
