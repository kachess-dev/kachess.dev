original_content: "The Stranger's Morning News Roundup. by Megan Seling\n\n**Welcome
  to Day 10 of the 2025 Government Shutdown** : Yesterday, despite the shutdown, [the
  senate passed](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/09/us/senate-passes-bipartisan-925-billion-defense-policy-bill.html)
  the $925 billion national defense bill, which allows everything from new submarines
  and fighter jets to an annual pay increase for troops. That said, because of the
  shutdown, members of the military [may not get their paychecks](https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/10/10/congress/timely-troop-pay-is-now-in-trumps-hands-00601881)—for
  the first time in the history of America—come October 15.\n\n**Trump Did Not Win
  the Nobel Peace Prize** : Hahahahahahahahaha! He wanted it so badly, too. Loser.\n\n**María
  Corina Machado Wins Nobel Peace Prize** : She is an opposition leader in Venezuela
  who lost the 2024 election to President Nicolás Maduro. The prize committee [praised
  her](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maria-corina-machado-nobel-peace-prize-venezuela.html)
  for “tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for
  her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.”
  Kind of the opposite vibes of ol’ Trumpty Dumpty’s vibes! Sorry, Don!\n\n**Ceasefire
  in Effect** : Israel and Hamas have [agreed to a ceasefire](https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-hostages-trump-peace-plan-e3d0ce091be56cc29207e566ff1603af)
  in Gaza. Now both sides have [72 hours](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgqx7ygq41o)
  to make good on their side of the deal—Hamas will release the 20 remaining Israeli
  hostages and Israel will release “around 250 Palestinian prisoners and 1,700 detainees
  from Gaza.” The BBC also reports that “about 600 humanitarian aid trucks are expected
  to enter Gaza daily.” Read Trump’s full [20-point Gaza peace plan here](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70155nked7o).\n\n**Seattle
  School Board Rejects Cops at Garfield** : The plan, supported by Mayor Harrell,
  would’ve placed a uniformed SPD officer on Garflied’s campus, but Capitol Hill Seattle
  [reports](https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2025/10/seattle-public-schools-rejects-plan-supported-by-mayor-and-police-chief-that-would-have-stationed-cop-at-garfield-high-school/%23more-2067292710)
  that the school board had “concerns over disproportionate policing and the district’s
  failure to implement community recommendations in its proposal.”\n\n**Trump Cannot
  Send the National Guard to Chicago** : Yesterday, a US district judge [ruled](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/09/trump-national-guard-troops-chicago-ruling)that
  the Trump administration cannot “federalize or deploy” the national guard to Illinois
  for two weeks because she had “seen no credible evidence that there is a danger
  of a rebellion in the state of Illinois.” The Trump administration will likely appeal.\n\n**And!
  The National Guard Can’t Fuck with Protestors in Chicago, Either** : A federal judge
  in Chicago also [granted a temporary restraining order](https://www.nprillinois.org/chicago-il/2025-10-09/judge-grants-restraining-order-protecting-protesters-journalists-in-chicago-area-protests)
  yesterday, blocking federal agencies from interfering with protestors and any journalists
  covering those protests. They can’t arrest or use physical force against journalists
  and they can’t use “riot control” weapons including tear gas and other “less-lethal”
  weapons and ammunition against protestors.\n\n**Oregon Might Not Be So Lucky** :
  Yesterday, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals began considering whether or not the
  Trump administration is allowed to deploy the national guard to “war ravaged” Portland.
  The 9th Circuit Court ruled on Saturday that they could _not_ be deployed, but the
  Trump administration appealed the ruling and now the appeals court is being a butt
  about it. Judge Ryan Nelson, one of three judges on the panel (and a Trump-appointee)
  doesn’t really [see a problem with it](https://www.axios.com/local/portland/2025/10/09/oregon-national-guard-ninth-circuit-trump).
  “What I'm struggling with is, the president gets to direct his resources as he deems
  fit, and it just seems a little counterintuitive to me that the city of Portland
  can come in and say 'No. You need to do it differently,'\" he said. EXCEPT FOR THAT
  TRUMP IS LYING??? There’s no war-torn city! There is no insurrection! Trump and
  his fascist bootlickers are trying to supress freedom of speech and the right to
  assemble because they want to shut up the people who are protesting his administration’s
  [ILLEGAL ABDUCTIONS OF AMERICAN CITIZENS](https://www.opb.org/article/2025/10/09/milwaukie-man-ice-arrest/).\n\n**When
  You’re Being Mean to Portland, This Is Who You’re Being Mean to:**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>
  The following is REAL footage from Portland, 2025. Viewer discretion is advised.

  Brain Hurts** : It was very hard to make sense of all the lawsuits and rulings and
  the national guard can be deployed here but not here at least for now but not later
  nonsense so early in the morning so please join me while I take a soothing brain
  break and watch a baby hippo named Mars refuse to get out of the pool.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>

  Sports Update** : At 5 pm the Mariners will play Game 5 in their post-season series
  against Detroit and the anxiety is palpable. We are not used to playoff baseball!
  We have, as a city, forgotten how nervewracking it can be! The winner will advance
  to the American League Championship Series to take on the Toronto Blue Jays, who
  are not an American team. Baseball! In other sports news, the Seattle Kraken kicked

  day.\n\nHow about one more Mars video, as a palate cleanser?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> [&nbsp;
