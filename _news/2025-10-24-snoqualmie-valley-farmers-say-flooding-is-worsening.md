Farmers in Snoqualmie Valley are noticing increased flooding, which they attribute to changes in the weather and river management. The owner of Jubilee Farm expressed concerns that his farm may ultimately be lost due to these floods. The rising waters not only destroy crops but also erode the land, making it less suitable for farming. Local farmers are seeking solutions, but it remains a challenging issue due to the complexity of river systems and the unpredictability of weather patterns.
