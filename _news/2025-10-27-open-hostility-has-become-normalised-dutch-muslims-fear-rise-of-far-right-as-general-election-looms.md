A controversial social media post by far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders has sparked outrage and a record 14,000 complaints to the country's anti-discrimination hotline. The post showed a drawing of two women - a friendly blonde and a scowling woman in a headscarf - with a caption referring to the upcoming general election. Critiques likened the image to World War II Nazi propaganda. The incident has heightened concerns about the hardening of political discourse in the Netherlands, with some viewing the general election as a test of the country's democratic ideals. The 19 anti-discrimination agencies associated with the hotline reported the post to the police over fears it could incite hatred.
