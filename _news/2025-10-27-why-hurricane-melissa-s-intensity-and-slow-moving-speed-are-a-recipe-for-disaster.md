![Hurricane Melissa](https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/3000x2286+0+0/resize/3000x2286!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F05%2Fa8%2Fe0df3152435f9819e0d051d2bad9%2Fgettyimages-2243296389.jpg)

Hurricane Melissa, a Category 5 storm, is currently moving northwest through the Caribbean Sea, as per the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) satellite images. It's causing major concerns for both Jamaica and Cuba. The slow speed of the storm could potentially result in devastating impacts similar to Hurricane Harvey in 2017.
