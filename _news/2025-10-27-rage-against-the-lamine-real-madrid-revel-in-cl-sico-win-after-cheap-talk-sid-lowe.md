  It was just like old times as Dani Carvajal sparked a full-time ruckus with Barça’s teenage star after his pre-match barbs

  “As long as I win they can’t say anything,” Lamine Yamal said once, but this time he didn’t win and they were coming for him. They said he spoke too much; they replied that, yeah, they _would_ see him outside; they told him talk is cheap. And that was just the players: there was more from the preachers in their pulpits, men who never lose.

  On the eve of the clásico, the teenager who claims he left fear behind in Mataró suggested that Real Madrid rob and moan, or so it goes. He also offered a reminder that [the last time he had been at the Santiago Bernabéu](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/28/barcelona-lamine-yamal-bernabeu-real-madrid-playground) – a kid with _blaugrana_ braces, a glint in his eye and a right foot they didn’t know he had – [he beat them 4-0](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2024/oct/26/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-clasico-match-report).

In a recent clash between Real Madrid and Barcelona, Real Madrid celebrated victory. Lamine Yamal, the teenage star from Barcelona, faced backlash from his pre-match comments. A year ago, he had led Barcelona to a 4-0 victory against Madrid at Santiago Bernabeu. However, this time he was defeated, leading to criticism from both players and spectators, who highlighted that talk is cheap without a win to back it up. Despite Yamal's previous claims of fearlessness, this defeat suggested a shift in dynamics.
