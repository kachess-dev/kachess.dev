Cindy Blackmore, manager of C.C.’s Espresso and Ice Creamery in Duvall for the past 20 years, needs a new ice cream freezer. Her friend Terri DeSelle has set up a GoFundMe campaign to help raise the necessary funds. The store, a beloved local business, has been struggling due to the pandemic, and the broken freezer has added to the financial strain. The community is rallying around the business, contributing to the campaign to help it stay afloat.
