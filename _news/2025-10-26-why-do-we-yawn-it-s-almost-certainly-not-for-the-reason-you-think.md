  Given that we’ve literally grown up with them, we often know surprisingly little about how our bodies work. This new series aims to fill the gaps

  All vertebrates yawn, or indulge in a behaviour that’s at least recognisable as yawn-adjacent. Sociable baboons yawn, but so do semi-solitary orangutans. Parakeets, penguins and crocodiles yawn – and so, probably, did the first ever jawed fish. Until relatively recently, the purpose of yawning wasn’t clear, and it’s still contested by researchers and scientists. But this commonality provides a clue to what it’s really all about – and it’s probably not what you’re expecting.

  “When I poll audiences and ask: ‘Why do _you_ think we yawn?’, most people suggest that it has to do with breathing or respiration and might somehow increase oxygen in the blood,” says Andrew Gallup, a professor in behavioural biology at Johns Hopkins University. “And that’s intuitive because most yawns do have this clear respiratory component, this deep inhalation of air. However, what most people don’t realise is that that hypothesis has been explicitly tested and shown to be false.”

All vertebrates, from baboons to crocodiles, exhibit yawning or yawn-like behavior. Despite its ubiquity, the purpose of yawning remains a contentious topic among researchers. Contrary to popular belief, yawning does not increase oxygen in the blood, says Andrew Gallup, a professor in behavioural biology at Johns Hopkins University. The actual reason for yawning is still under investigation, but it's likely not related to respiration as commonly thought.
