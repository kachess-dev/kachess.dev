original_content: "His Recent Attacks on Wilson Are Sexist and Classist. They’re Also
  Factually Wrong, Her Family Says.\n by Marcus Harrison Green \n\nOn October 21,
  KUOW published a story with the headline: “Katie Wilson can barely afford to live
  in Seattle. That's why she wants to be mayor.” The story then goes on to reveal
  that while she “speaks the language of the working people,” there’s something missing
  from her campaign narrative: “Her parents give her money,” the reporter wrote.\n\nHarrell’s
  campaign seized on the idea that support from her parents undermines Wilson’s credentials
  as an advocate for working-class Seattleites. Two days after the KUOW article came
  out, Harrell sent out a press release with the headline: “Katie Wilson is Not Who
  She Says She Is.” It went on to say that the profile “shatters Wilson’s carefully
  constructed narrative: she is not a working-class Seattle resident, and doesn’t
  bear the stress felt by cost-pressured Seattleites.” His campaign website dedicates
  an entire page to the article.\n\nAnd this weekend, a bunch of Seattleites got a
  text from the Bruce for Seattle campaign linking to the KUOW like a tabloid scandal:
  “Katie Wilson’s campaign built around working class identity, but parents paid her
  bills.”\n\nIt was a classist, sexist attack from a millionaire with a household
  income that falls somewhere between $500,000 and $1.2 million.\n\nAccording to Wilson’s
  family, it also wasn’t true.\n\nFor the two decades Wilson’s been in Seattle, “we
  have been very apart from her finances,” Wilson’s mother, Anne Clark, tells _The
  Stranger_. “We haven’t had anything to do with supporting her materially, in any
  way.”\n\nThat only changed earlier this year, when Wilson told her parents that
  she planned to run for mayor. Clark knew that campaigns are enormously taxing, and
  that Wilson and her husband had been getting by without paying for childcare up
  to that point. She and Wilson’s dad thought they might be able to help with the
  stress by contributing to the cost of Josie’s daycare. “I don’t even think we cover
  the whole cost,” she says. And, she clarifies, she has never underwritten Wilson’s
  bills. “I don’t even know what her bills are.”\n\nShe says she plans to keep helping
  when she sees opportunities to. “This is my only grandchild. What grandparent doesn’t
  want to invest in their grandchild if they can?”\n\nClark has read the KUOW story
  about Wilson. She was “irritated and amused,” she says. “It made me think: I don’t
  know who wrote that for Harrell's campaign. But he has kids. Surely he’s invested
  in his kids.”\n\nEven without the clarification from Clark, the story was a relatable
  one for a lot of voters. Nearly [half of millennials](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/25/half-of-parents-financially-support-adult-children-report-finds.html)
  and Gen Zers rely, in some measure, on familial support. That help may take the
  form of a grocery run, a lingering phone plan, a subsidized insurance premium, or
  the occasional rent check, small acts of intergenerational care, as wages have lagged
  farther and farther behind [inflation](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/wages-income-falling-behind-inflation-jobs-profession-education-manufacturing/).\n\nThe
  original story clearly lays out a narrative that Wilson would not be able to live
  in Seattle without her parents’ support. “Wilson presents herself as a sensible
  coalition-builder who runs a small nonprofit—the Transit Riders Union – and has
  lived a mostly working-class life. A renter and a mother, she runs on issues close
  to her heart. She speaks the language of struggling people,” the story reads. “But
  not included in the narrative Wilson tells on the campaign trail is how she affords
  this expensive city. The answer is simple, and arguably very Seattle: Her parents,
  professors in New York State, give her money.”\n\nWilson’s campaign reached out
  to KUOW to request a correction or clarification in the story. The news station
  said they wouldn’t add a correction or editor’s note because the article was inspiring
  “really interesting conversations about what it takes to live in the city,” and
  that they would prefer to simply do a follow-up interview. The Wilson campaign declined.\n\n_The
  Stranger&nbsp;_contacted the station over the weekend to ask if they wanted to comment
  about their decision to not clarify the story. On Monday morning, they added an
  editor’s note stating that they’d added “context and an additional quote” to “further
  illuminate Katie Wilson’s parents’ financial support.”\n\nThe two paragraphs read:\n\n>
  “Before I decided to run for office, my husband and I were just kind of juggling
  our kid back and forth,” Wilson said. “We didn't have her in daycare because it's
  so expensive. But then when I decided to run, we're like, we really need childcare.”\n>
  \n> Wilson has mentioned the exorbitant cost of child care in Seattle throughout
  the campaign —[noting what it costs to send her 2-year-old to daycare](https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/mamdani-progressivism-socialism-seattle-mayor/)
  — but without noting how she paid for it.\n\nThe changes do not address the clear
  narrative in the story that Wilson could not live in Seattle without her parents’
  support—something she did for decades. “We stand by our reporting and plainly did
  not state that Katie Wilson was receiving money from her parents at any other period
  than what she told us herself,” the station said in a comment.&nbsp;\n\nThere are
  eight days left in this campaign season. Polls from _The Stranger_ and Northwest
  Progressive Institute both show Wilson in the lead, but this election will all depend
  on turnout. And so for those eight days, we should expect a lot of the same: Wilson
  holding rally after rally trying to get out the vote, and Harrell pulling out every
  class-shaming, sexist half-truth he can find to make voters wonder if maybe they
  just shouldn’t vote this time around."

A KUOW article claimed Katie Wilson, running for Seattle mayor, relies on her parents' financial support, which was used by Bruce Harrell's campaign to attack her working-class credibility. However, Wilson's mother, Anne Clark, stated they only started helping with her granddaughter's daycare costs after Wilson decided to run for office. The KUOW piece suggested Wilson wouldn't be able to live in Seattle without her parents' aid, a claim Wilson's campaign tried to correct with KUOW, but the station refused. The controversy comes as the mayoral race enters its final stages, with Wilson leading in the polls.
