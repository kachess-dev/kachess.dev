original_content: "The Stranger's morning news roundup.\n          \n            by
  Vivian McCall\n          \n          \n          \n            <p><strong>Can He
  Do That? </strong>Bruce Harrell spoke at a fundraiser for the Political Action Committee
  supporting his campaign, <a href=\"https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/10/15/80284220/bruce-harrell-spoke-at-a-fundraiser-for-the-pac-supporting-him\">according
  to an email invitation obtained by <em>The Stranger</em></a><em>. </em>The state’s
  election authority told us it’s “unusual” and introduces questions about campaign
  financing. Like if he’s doing it legally. The law is complex, so at this point,
  it’s unclear if Harrell violated campaign finance law. His campaign didn’t clear
  it up for us.</p>\n<p><strong>Good Guy Harrell: </strong>Mothers who lost their
  sons to gun violence <a href=\"https://publicola.com/2025/10/16/it-was-cold-mothers-who-lost-children-to-gun-violence-say-harrell-ignored-their-pleas-for-help/\">told
  Publicola</a> that Mayor Harrell ignored their pleas for help during his years in
  office, and only reached out to some during his reelection campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>These
  mothers</strong> included Nicky Chappell, mother of D’Vonne Pickett. Pickett owned
  The Postman mailing and shipping store in the Central District. He was shot and
  killed outside his store three years ago. Thousands attended Pickett’s memorial
  at Climate Pledge Arena. Harrell spoke, saying that what happened to Pickett happened
  “time and time again” when he was a little boy in the Central District. “We have
  to do everything humanly possible to save our own community, because no one’s going
  to do it for us,” he said. “We have to hold up the family. You don’t say, ‘What
  can I do? Do it.’” Apparently, “no one” included Harrell. Chappell said the Mayor
  didn’t speak to or acknowledge her at the memorial, and hasn’t reached out in the
  years since.</p>\n            <p><strong>“Don’t Come Half-Assed”: </strong>Publicola
  also spoke to Black business owners and advocates who’ve met with Wilson and support
  her because they think she’ll make a place for them at the table. “Some wouldn’t
  go on the record, citing a fear of retribution if Harrell gets reelected,” Publicola
  wrote. “Others talked at length about their disappointment with a mayor they thought
  would stand up for their communities.”</p>\n<p><strong>The Weather: </strong>Charles
  can finally rest easy. The clouds have arrived, and they’re multiplying. Tomorrow,
  there’s a 50 percent chance of rain. Saturday, a late morning rain is likely. Sunday,
  expect early morning rain and showers after 11 a.m. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday?
  Rain, rain, rain (probably.)</p>\n<p><strong>Sorry, M’s: </strong>The Blue Jays

  5 p.m. Wednesday.</a> Police found him in a hotel parking lot near the 2100 block
  of Northgate Way. He’d been shot in the chest and died at the scene. There are no
  suspects in custody, police said.</p>\n<p><strong>ICE Wrongfully Detained Seattle
  Man: </strong>This July, Alan Phetsadakone sat down for a routine meeting with Immigration
  and Customs Enforcement, like he’d done in the decades since his felony conviction
  for bank fraud. At the time, he’d been issued a deportation order to Laos, which
  he left as a child refugee. Laos wasn’t accepting deportees, so Phetsadakone was
  released on the condition of these regular check-ins. But on this visit, ICE detained
  him without warning and took him to the ICE detention center in Tacoma. A judge
  later ruled his detention was unlawful. <a href=\"https://www.kuow.org/stories/judge-rules-ice-unlawfully-detained-a-seattle-man-he-s-not-alone\">As

  End who are pregnant, postpartum, or have children under five could lose access
  to the infant formula, healthy food, and other assistance they get through the Women,
  Children, and Infants program. On October 1, officials announced it had one or two
  weeks of funding left.</p>\n<p><strong>Nauseating: </strong>A 9-year-old boy and
  10-year-old girl in Ohio have been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/ohio-children-attempted-murder-rape.html\">charged</a>
  with allegedly assaulting, strangling, raping, and then attempting to murder a 5-year-old
  girl in a Cleveland field last month. All we know: The victim’s mother posted about
  the crime on Facebook and said her daughter’s hair had been pulled from her scalp.
  The Cleveland police acknowledged the post and that they were investigating a case
  with multiple children under the age of 10. It has declined to comment further.
  The prosecutor’s office in Cuyahoga County filed the charges in juvenile court yesterday.
  The two children have not been arraigned yet. Because the suspects are under 14,

The Stranger's morning news roundup. by Vivian McCall

**Can He Do That?&nbsp;** Bruce Harrell spoke at a fundraiser for the Political Action Committee supporting his campaign, [according to an email invitation obtained by _The Stranger_](https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/10/15/80284220/bruce-harrell-spoke-at-a-fundraiser-for-the-pac-supporting-him)_._ The state’s election authority told us it’s “unusual” and introduces questions about campaign financing.

I have only one thing to say…

**Shooting:** A 20-year-old man was shot and killed in Northgate [around 5 p.m. Wednesday.](https://www.king5.com/article/news/crime/1-dead-northgate-shooting/281-a075775d-7e15-45f0-89f4-fd15fa37652f) Police found him in a hotel parking lot near the 2100 block of Northgate Way.
