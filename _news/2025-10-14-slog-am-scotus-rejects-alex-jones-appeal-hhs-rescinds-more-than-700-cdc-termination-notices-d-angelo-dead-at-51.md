original_content: "The Stranger's morning news roundup. by Micah Yip\n\n**Takesies
  Backsies:** The Department of Health and Human Services [rescinded about 700 of
  the 1,300 termination notices](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/13/firings-cdc-employees-reversed%23:~:text=On%2520Saturday,%2520the%2520New%2520York,been%2520recalled%2520to%2520their%2520roles.)
  they sent to CDC workers this weekend. HHS claims the notices were mistakenly sent
  due to a “coding error.” The layoffs included members of the Epidemic Intelligence
  Service and two people leading the measles outbreak response. Who needs’em, right?
  (The US has confirmed more than 1,500 cases this year, [the highest number in three
  decades](https://www.npr.org/2025/10/12/nx-s1-5572507/us-measles-outbreaks-texas-south-carolina-utah-minnesota).)\n\n**CourtWars:**
  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones will have to pay the $1.4 billion judgment against
  him for spreading lies that the Sandy Hook school shooting was staged. The Supreme
  Court of the United States rejected his appeal without even asking the victims’
  families to respond—the judicial way of saying, “Don’t waste our time, man.” Jones
  argued he never got a fair trial, which is rich coming from a guy who spent years
  yelling about “crisis actors” instead of turning over discovery documents.&nbsp;\n\n**News
  flash, Hegseth!** Major news outlets, including _The New York Times_, the Associated
  Press, Reuters, _The Atlantic_, _The Washington Post_, and even the far-right Newsmax,
  are refusing to sign the Defense Department's new media access pledge. The pledge
  is a gag. It limits journalists from much of the Pentagon without escort and gives
  the Secretary of WAR!!! the power to personally revoke the credentials of any reporter
  who seeks information that he has not approved for release. Any outlet that refuses
  to sign will likely get their reporters kicked out of the Pentagon, according to
  [the AP](https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-press-access-defense-department-rules-95878bce05096912887701eaa6d019c6).\n\n**Reporters
  say it’s a First Amendment Nightmare:&nbsp;** The sign-or-get-out rule that makes
  transparency sound like treason. _The_ _New York Times_ posted on X that “The public
  has a right to know how the government and military are operating. The Times is
  dedicated to pursuing the public interest through deep, fair reporting and an unwavering
  pursuit of the facts.” Hegseth responded by [retweeting](https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1977808951338307907)
  the _Times’_ statement, adding “\U0001F44B.”\n\n**Extreme Stream Makeover:** In
  a press release for _F1: The Movie,_ Apple announced Apple TV+ is rebranding as
  Apple TV. “Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant new identity,” the release
  read. Vibrant new identity TBD.\n\n**Dallas ICE Shooter Was “Completely Normal”
  Until He Moved to Washington:** The man who shot and killed two detainees and injured
  a third at a Dallas ICE facility last month became convinced he’d contracted radiation
  sickness while working at a marijuana farm near the Hanford site in southeast Washington,
  [according to records obtained by the Associated Press](https://apnews.com/article/dallas-shooter-ice-facility-jahn-radiation-0d930ab69bf747e1b40f630b49ebc810).
  Returning home because of this belief, Joshua Jahn, 29, became obsessed with AI,
  avoided touching plastic, and played thousands of hours of shooter games with the
  username “Frank Hoenniker,” a misspelling of Frank Hoenikker, a character from Kurt
  Vonnegut’s _Cat’s Cradle._ The FBI, short-staffed by the shutdown, says it’s “focused
  on essential public safety.” Translation: Don’t expect answers soon.\n\n**And Now,
  the Weather:&nbsp;** It’ll be sunny and a little windy, with temps in the high 50s.
  Tomorrow, it’s more of the same with a high of 61. On Friday, there’s a chance of
  morning showers.\n\n**Orcas Island Activist Released from Israeli Prison After Gaza
  Flotilla Arrest:** After several days in Israeli prison, 32-year-old activist and
  sailor Jasmine Ikeda returned home to Orcas Island on Sunday night. Ikeda was one
  of 400 activists aboard the _Global Sumud Flotilla,_ a humanitarian convoy challenging
  Israel’s aid blockade. [Speaking to KING 5](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/orcas-island-activist-released-after-several-days-israeli-prison/281-aa3fa4f1-e11e-4dfc-a50b-26fbd7d628a0?tbref=hp),
  Ikeda said Israeli naval forces had surrounded her boat, came aboard, and held activists
  at gunpoint for nearly 20 hours. After her arrest, Ikeda said she’d shared a four-person
  cell with 14 people. She slept on concrete and saw Israeli soldiers beat her fellow
  prisoners, she said.\n\n**Mariners Crush Blue Jays:&nbsp;** The Seattle Mariners
  are just two wins away from their first-ever World Series appearance after obliterating
  the Toronto Blue Jays 10–3 on Monday, [KUOW wrote.](https://www.kuow.org/stories/seattle-mariners-take-2-0-alcs-lead-beat-blue-jays-10-3-as-rodriguez-polanco-and-naylor-homer)
  Julio Rodríguez and Jorge Polanco hit three-run homers, and Joshua Naylor added
  a two-run shot. The Blue Jays, meanwhile, managed only six hits all game, leaving
  a crowd of 44,000 with nothing to celebrate on Canadian Thanksgiving. The Mariners
  play at home tomorrow in Game 3, and the team is up 2–0 in the AL Championship Series.\n\n**Leaving
  Paid Leave Without Pay:** Washington’s paid family and medical leave program is
  so popular that it could go broke. The Washington State Standard [reported](https://washingtonstatestandard.com/2025/10/13/washingtons-paid-leave-program-heads-toward-a-fiscal-cliff/)
  that it faced a&nbsp;$350 million deficit&nbsp;by 2029 unless lawmakers raise taxes
  or cut benefits. The state paid more than $2 billion in benefits to roughly 240,000
  Washingtonians last year, a $300 million jump from 2023. Premiums are rising. Next
  year, the state will take 1.13 percent of our paychecks, up from 0.92 percent. It’ll
  hit the state’s legal cap of 1.2 percent by 2027.&nbsp;\n\n**Campaign Sign Killing
  Case Dismissed:** A Skagit County judge dismissed the case against Angela Conijn,
  a woman accused of shooting and killing Kamran Cohee in 2021 during a fight over
  a Loren Culp for Governor sign, [KING 5 reported](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/case-dismissed-against-angela-conijn-campaign-sign-killing/281-d3f88ab3-82bb-4a00-9eeb-3bc9b2fd5691?tbref=hp).
  Conijn was also exonerated of bail. The defense argued Conijn acted in self-defense.
  Prosecutors argued that Conijn fired after the confrontation was over, and called
  the ruling “an inaccurate reflection of the facts and law.” They plan to appeal.
  A March trial ended in a hung jury.\n\n**Only 74 Southern Resident Orcas Left:**
  The latest census from the Center for Whale Research shows just 74 orcas total across
  J, K, and L pods, with K pod falling to 14, the lowest total recorded. Researchers
  say too many newborn calves are dying, and not enough are being born. Whale moms
  are starving. Their main food source, Chinook salmon, is depleted thanks to decades
  of damming, pollution, and climate stress.&nbsp;\n\n**:(** : Neo-soul pioneer D’Angelo
  [died from pancreatic cancer](https://variety.com/2025/music/news/dangelo-dead-neo-soul-pioneer-untitled-voodoo-1236552500/)
  this morning. He was 51."
