  included members of the Epidemic Intelligence Service and two people leading the
  measles outbreak response. Who needs’em, right? (The US has confirmed more than
  1,500 cases this year, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/12/nx-s1-5572507/us-measles-outbreaks-texas-south-carolina-utah-minnesota\">the

  judicial way of saying, “Don’t waste our time, man.” Jones argued he never got a

  flash, Hegseth!</strong> Major news outlets, including <em>The New York Times</em>,
  the Associated Press, Reuters, <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>The Washington Post</em>,
  and even the far-right Newsmax, are refusing to sign the Defense Department's new
  media access pledge. The pledge is a gag. It limits journalists from much of the
  Pentagon without escort and gives the Secretary of WAR!!! the power to personally
  revoke the credentials of any reporter who seeks information that he has not approved
  for release. Any outlet that refuses to sign will likely get their reporters kicked
  out of the Pentagon, according to <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-press-access-defense-department-rules-95878bce05096912887701eaa6d019c6\">the
  AP</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Reporters say it’s a First Amendment Nightmare: </strong>The
  sign-or-get-out rule that makes transparency sound like treason. <em>The</em> <em>New
  York Times</em> posted on X that “The public has a right to know how the government
  and military are operating. The Times is dedicated to pursuing the public interest
  through deep, fair reporting and an unwavering pursuit of the facts.” Hegseth responded
  by <a href=\"https://x.com/PeteHegseth/status/1977808951338307907\">retweeting</a>
  the <em>Times’</em> statement, adding “\U0001F44B.”</p>\n<p><strong>Extreme Stream
  Makeover: </strong>In a press release for <em>F1: The Movie, </em>Apple announced
  Apple TV+ is rebranding as Apple TV. “Apple TV+ is now simply Apple TV, with a vibrant
  new identity,” the release read. Vibrant new identity TBD.</p>\n<p><strong>Dallas
  ICE Shooter Was “Completely Normal” Until He Moved to Washington: </strong>The man
  who shot and killed two detainees and injured a third at a Dallas ICE facility last
  month became convinced he’d contracted radiation sickness while working at a marijuana

  belief, Joshua Jahn, 29, became obsessed with AI, avoided touching plastic, and
  played thousands of hours of shooter games with the username “Frank Hoenniker,”
  a misspelling of Frank Hoenikker, a character from Kurt Vonnegut’s <em>Cat’s Cradle.
  </em>The FBI, short-staffed by the shutdown, says it’s “focused on essential public
  safety.” Translation: Don’t expect answers soon.</p>\n<p><strong>And Now, the Weather: </strong>It’ll

  to KING 5</a>, Ikeda said Israeli naval forces had surrounded her boat, came aboard,
  and held activists at gunpoint for nearly 20 hours. After her arrest, Ikeda said
  she’d shared a four-person cell with 14 people. She slept on concrete and saw Israeli
