  Ariel Kuaray Ortega’s complex docufiction sifts through the mysterious story of a man who, during the military tyranny, is said to have become a big cat

  Here is a complex, mysterious docufictional mediation which unfolds at an unhurried walking pace, co-authored by the Indigenous Brazilian film-maker Ariel Kuaray Ortega, a member of the Mbyá-Guarani movie collective; it’s evidently been a personal project, many years in the making, and a prizewinner at the 2023 IDFA festival in Amsterdam. Ortega returns to his home town in a remote forested region on the border with Argentina, on a mission to investigate a local legend that a man called Canuto, from his grandfather’s generation, was transformed into a jaguar.

  The film is at once a documentary on this subject and a record of the fictional re-enactment that Ortega is staging using local people – and, in a way, it is a film about itself. He speaks to his aged grandfather and to villagers about their customs and beliefs and their fraught relationship with the military tyranny of the time; it was [a period notorious for the](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/22/argentina.ianblack)_[desaparecidos](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/22/argentina.ianblack)_[– the “disappeared”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/22/argentina.ianblack) – which provides an enigmatic political context for Canuto’s vanishing and the authorities who appropriated their lands without compensation. There are also sharp comments on a certain high-handed “white architect” who designed an award-winning wooden community centre for them, which the community itself regards as exasperatingly flimsy and unfit for purpose, and which they plan to break up for lumber.

Ariel Kuaray Ortega's docufiction, "Canuto's Transformation," explores a local legend about a man, Canuto, who supposedly transformed into a jaguar during the military tyranny. This film, a product of years of personal investment and winner at the 2023 IDFA festival, balances between a documentary and a fictional re-enactment featuring local people. Ortega's narrative includes discussions about customs, beliefs, and the community's tense relationship with the military tyranny. The film also criticizes a "white architect" whose award-winning community center design is viewed as impractical by the local community.
