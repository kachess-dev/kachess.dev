  Sitting down all day is bad for our health. So can micro-movements – three minutes at a time – help us get fitter?

  Fiorella Rafael remembers feeling stiff at the end of every day in her old office job. “That lack of movement would creep up and compound over the week,” she says. Though standing and walking meetings were encouraged, with deadlines to meet it wasn’t always tenable. “It’s partly what drove me to become a pilates instructor,” she says.

  Now Rafael teaches pilates at Sydney’s Scout Studios, where she meets people like me who spend far too much time sitting.

Fiorella Rafael, a pilates instructor at Sydney's Scout Studios, highlights the issue of sedentary jobs. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, 46.9% of Australian adults have jobs that involve mostly sitting, leading to only 22.4% meeting the physical activity guidelines in 2022. The situation is similar in England and the US, with one in four doing less than 30 minutes of exercise a week and only half of the adult population meeting exercise guidelines, respectively. The World Health Organization states that nearly 1.8 billion people worldwide are at risk of disease due to insufficient physical activity.
