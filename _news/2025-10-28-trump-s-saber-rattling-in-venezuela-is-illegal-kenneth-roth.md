Trump’s threats against the country and attacks on nearby boats cannot be justified under international law

We should not be surprised that [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump), having had no problem aiding and abetting Israel’s genocide in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza), is willing to flout the law when it comes to his bellicose threats to Venezuela and his lethal attacks on nearby alleged drug-running boats. Living up to the “No Kings” fears expressed by protesters across the United States, Trump acts as if he is above the law. The only way to rein in such criminality is to show his followers the dangerous implications of his conduct.

Despite his administration’s [vow](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/us/politics/jd-vance-shifting-positions.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) to launch “no more open-ended conflicts”, Trump has summoned an [aircraft carrier](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-warship-maduro-uss-gerald-ford-21cc3ac03f755a657c0541667246c007?user_email=833907525a7ed9da50588421f9a328c4ffe67eebcd2f30e04f9a17ca5f772e12&utm_medium=Morning_Wire&utm_source=Sailthru_AP&utm_campaign=MorningWire_Sun_Oct26_2025&utm_term=Morning%20Wire%20Subscribers) to the Caribbean Sea and is already sending military [helicopters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/16/special-operations-helicopters-venezuela/) provocatively near the Venezuelan coast. The Trump administration [denies](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/23/us-boat-strikes-pacific-caribbean-venezuela-trump-drug-war-maduro/) that its goal is regime change, but that certainly seems to be the purpose, as some officials privately [concede](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/us/politics/jd-vance-shifting-positions.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). Ousting Venezuela’s autocratic leader, [Nicolás Maduro](https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro), has long been a [goal](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/marco-rubio-trump-venezuela-policy-afe1ab2c?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqc5arcp8eepXvaMsM-6oDi8h2IWZNR9LPOYFEC197kM11piHLbjObEM19lNeHU%3D&gaa_ts=68ffaea7&gaa_sig=q9y7-wLMyqPsHxTbm-0BJ9lqfjlq8QR44xLqMYB2eMOJyC2ldNMVhDAu4BxeRIy3ot0VqIF9v92gTBoimE4wnQ%3D%3D) of Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state.
