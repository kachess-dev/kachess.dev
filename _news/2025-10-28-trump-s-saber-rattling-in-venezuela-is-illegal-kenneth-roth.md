  Trump’s threats against the country and attacks on nearby boats cannot be justified under international law

  We should not be surprised that [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump), having had no problem aiding and abetting Israel’s genocide in [Gaza](https://www.theguardian.com/world/gaza), is willing to flout the law when it comes to his bellicose threats to Venezuela and his lethal attacks on nearby alleged drug-running boats. Living up to the “No Kings” fears expressed by protesters across the United States, Trump acts as if he is above the law. The only way to rein in such criminality is to show his followers the dangerous implications of his conduct.

  Despite his administration’s [vow](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/us/politics/jd-vance-shifting-positions.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare) to launch “no more open-ended conflicts”, Trump has summoned an [aircraft carrier](https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-warship-maduro-uss-gerald-ford-21cc3ac03f755a657c0541667246c007?user_email=833907525a7ed9da50588421f9a328c4ffe67eebcd2f30e04f9a17ca5f772e12&utm_medium=Morning_Wire&utm_source=Sailthru_AP&utm_campaign=MorningWire_Sun_Oct26_2025&utm_term=Morning%20Wire%20Subscribers) to the Caribbean Sea and is already sending military [helicopters](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/16/special-operations-helicopters-venezuela/) provocatively near the Venezuelan coast. The Trump administration [denies](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/10/23/us-boat-strikes-pacific-caribbean-venezuela-trump-drug-war-maduro/) that its goal is regime change, but that certainly seems to be the purpose, as some officials privately [concede](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/us/politics/jd-vance-shifting-positions.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&referringSource=articleShare). Ousting Venezuela’s autocratic leader, [Nicolás Maduro](https://www.theguardian.com/world/nicolas-maduro), has long been a [goal](https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/marco-rubio-trump-venezuela-policy-afe1ab2c?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=AWEtsqc5arcp8eepXvaMsM-6oDi8h2IWZNR9LPOYFEC197kM11piHLbjObEM19lNeHU%3D&gaa_ts=68ffaea7&gaa_sig=q9y7-wLMyqPsHxTbm-0BJ9lqfjlq8QR44xLqMYB2eMOJyC2ldNMVhDAu4BxeRIy3ot0VqIF9v92gTBoimE4wnQ%3D%3D) of Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state.

Donald Trump's threats against Venezuela and his attacks on nearby boats are considered as violations of international law. Despite his administration's vow to avoid open-ended conflicts, Trump has mobilized an aircraft carrier to the Caribbean Sea and dispatched military helicopters near the Venezuelan coast. While the Trump administration denies its intent is regime change, it seems to be the objective, according to some officials. The ousting of Venezuela's autocratic leader, Nicolás Maduro, has been a long-standing goal of US Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump's actions highlight the fears of protesters who believe he acts above the law.
