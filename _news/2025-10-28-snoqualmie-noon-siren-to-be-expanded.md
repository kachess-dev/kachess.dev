The Snoqualmie Valley Record reports that the Snoqualmie noon siren will be expanded. This traditional alarm, which sounds off daily at noon, is set for an upgrade. The City of Snoqualmie has been able to secure funds for the project. The siren, a long-standing element of the community's daily life, will now reach a wider area, keeping more people informed and safe. The expansion aims to continue the tradition while enhancing public safety in the growing city. The project details, such as the scale of the expansion and the timeline for its implementation, have not been disclosed.
