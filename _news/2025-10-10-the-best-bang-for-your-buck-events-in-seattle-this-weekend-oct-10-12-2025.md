  \ \nThere's a new reason to check out the Belltown Art Walk this week: Hotel Crocodile
  hosts a fireside chat organized by nonprofit As Many Weirdos As Possible, which
  works to preserve the history of the '80s and '90s Pacific Northwest music scene
  through storytelling. The chat will be moderated by former business partners Jared
  Lovejoy and Caroline Davenport, who founded a live music venue, a record label,
  a production company, and a creative agency that pioneered experiential marketing.
  The speaker lineup is full of legends, from KEXP DJ Darek Mazzone, who founded a
  nonprofit called SAMA that works to connect cultures through music, to Ricardo Frazer,
  who's managed Sir Mix-A-Lot for over 30 years and went from cleaning floors at the
  Paramount to becoming the chairman of STG's board of directors. Stop by to hear
  behind-the-scenes stories and funny anecdotes about what made the local '90s art
  scene particularly unique and impactful. **SHANNON LUBETICH**   \n_(Hotel Crocodile,
