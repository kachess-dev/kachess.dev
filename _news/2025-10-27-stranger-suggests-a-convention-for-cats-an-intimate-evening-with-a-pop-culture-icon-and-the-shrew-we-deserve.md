  Trivia Night**](https://everout.com/seattle/events/farmers-markets-halloween-trivia-night/e220176/)\n\n(TRIVIA)
  It’s Halloween week, which means you’d better plan carefully if you’re going to
  stretch that costume through Sunday. To kick things off while you dial in your KPop
  Demon Hunters wig, head to Halcyon Brewing for a festive night of trivia hosted
  by Neighborhood Farmers Markets and the Phinney Neighborhood Association. Go solo
  or bring a team of up to six for brews, bites, and bragging rights. Prizes will
  be given out for best costume, best team name, and top trivia champs, plus raffle
  giveaways from local vendors, with proceeds from the night supporting Seattle’s
  seasonal and year-round farmers markets. (_Halcyon Brewing Company, 5:45 pm, 21+_)

  __1___ 1_.webp)Olivie Blake will be at Third Place Books Lake Forest Park Tuesday,
  October 28. MICHELLE TERRIS\n\n(BOOKS) I’m very much here for the recent influx
  of dark feminist fiction about female appetites (e.g., _Woman, Eating_; _A Certain
  Hunger_; _Hungerstone_), so I was instantly hooked by the premise of _The Atlas
  Six_ author Olivie Blake’s new novel, _Girl Dinner_. College sophomore Nina Kaur
  is accepted into The House, the most sought-after sorority on campus. Meanwhile,
  adjunct professor Dr. Sloane Hartley, who is struggling to manage her career alongside
  the travails of new motherhood and a less-than-supportive husband, becomes the mysterious
  society’s new academic liaison. Soon, the two women find themselves pulled progressively
  deeper into an uncanny world of cannibalistic rituals and feminine rage. Blake will
  discuss her book with local speculative fiction writer Isabel Cañas, author of _The
  Possession of Alba Díaz_. (_Third Place Books Lake Forest Park, 7 pm, all ages_)
  JULIANNE BELL\n\n**WEDNESDAY 10/29** &nbsp;[_&nbsp;_](#Oct29)\n\n[**Shrew**](https://everout.com/seattle/events/shrew/e203965/)\n\n
  ![](https://media2.fdncms.com/stranger/imager/u/original/80300067/shrew_1080x1080.webp)\n\n(THEATER)
  We can all agree that Shakespeare is mad queer to begin with, but Union Arts Center’s
  Shrew really got the brief. This reimagining of _The Taming of the Shrew_ is almost
  completely true to the original script, but through costuming, blocking, and performance,
  director Bobbin Ramsey tells the story that we all hope ol’ Bill was trying to get
  at in the first place. Most of the male roles are played in drag. And in case you
  were wondering how Ramsey felt about the minor male characters vying for ownership
  of our female leads, several of them are played by the same hand puppet passed around
  by the actors in drag. This is the first Shakespearean play the theater has done
  since ACT Theatre and Seattle Shakespeare joined forces to create Union Arts Center,
  and came out with a bang. This is not Shrew a la _10 Things I Hate About You_ (though
  if you listen closely, you’ll catch a few references to it). This is a Shrew for
  2025, one where the Shrew is never tamed, and the patriarchy is a nightmare for
  everyone, not just her. (_Union Arts Center, through November 2_) HANNAH MURPHY

  OCHS ARCHIVES/GETTY IMAGES\n\n(BOOKS) Even if you have not read Pamela Des Barres’s
  1987 memoir, _I’m With the Band: Confessions of a Groupie_, I promise you’ve seen
  its mark on pop culture (see: Cameron Crowe’s _Almost Famous_). Along with being
  a best-selling author and the original “rockstar girlfriend,” Des Barres was also
  a member of all-female performance art troupe the GTOs (Girls Together Outrageously),
  who released the incredible experimental rock album _Permanent Damage_, produced
  by Frank Zappa, back in 1969. Des Barres will bring her one-woman show to the Rabbit
  Box to share her wit, wisdom, and firsthand experiences with everyone from Mick
  Jagger to the Manson Family. (_Rabbit Box Theatre, 8 pm, 21+_) AUDREY VANN\n\n**FRIDAY

  Chicago-based drag icon, recording artist, and _RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars_&nbsp;winner
  Shea Couleé is embarking on their first-ever headline DJ tour and bringing a “Halloween-inspired
  celebration of fantasy and fierce beats” to six different cities, and Seattle is
  lucky enough to host their tour stop on actual Halloween. Famed Chicago DJ MISTER
  WALLACE will join them, as will their drag sisters Kerri Colby, Aja, and Luxx Noir
  London. According to Shea, costumes are “not just encouraged, but expected,” so
  be sure to serve “dark glamour meets&nbsp;&nbsp;’90s nostalgia” to avoid having
  to sashay away—there might just be a prize awarded for the most sickening look.

  Just like the spirits of our forebearers, Seattle’s Catrinas Festival is _back_&nbsp;with
  a vibrant tribute to the ancestors and Mexican tradition featuring music, folklore,
  and a towering altar adorned with flowers and&nbsp;_ofrendas_ (offerings). Inspired
  by La Catrina (aka the iconic skeleton figure of Día de Muertos), this fest hosts
  live catrinas and catrines in full costume for an impressive living procession.
  Families are invited to bring photos and mementos of loved ones and enjoy a bustling
  street market with traditional food, crafts, art, face painting, and more. Plus,
  kids five and under are free. (_Town Hall, Sat–Sun, all ages_) LANGSTON THOMAS\n\n_Note:

  KIRKMAN\n\n(CATS) Dog people have the luxury of showing off their pets on daily
  walks, but we cat owners have to settle for photos, hoping that an image can convey
  our cat’s unique personality and star power—it’s not fair! Sea-Meow Con offers a
  rare oasis for cats and cat owners to strut their stuff in public, with two days
  dedicated to our feline friends. There will be merchants slinging cat-related goods
  (for both humans and cats), advocates, furries, speakers, musicians, filmmakers,
  and more. There will also be plenty of social cats on-site, including on leashes,
  in strollers, and in fenced areas for cuddling. (_Seattle Center Exhibition Hall,
