  Markets Halloween Trivia Night</strong></a></p>\n<p>(TRIVIA) It’s Halloween week,
  which means you’d better plan carefully if you’re going to stretch that costume
  through Sunday. To kick things off while you dial in your KPop Demon Hunters wig,
  head to Halcyon Brewing for a festive night of trivia hosted by Neighborhood Farmers
  Markets and the Phinney Neighborhood Association. Go solo or bring a team of up
  to six for brews, bites, and bragging rights. Prizes will be given out for best
  costume, best team name, and top trivia champs, plus raffle giveaways from local
  vendors, with proceeds from the night supporting Seattle’s seasonal and year-round
  farmers markets. (<em>Halcyon Brewing Company, 5:45 pm, 21+</em>) LANGSTON THOMAS</p>\n

  width=\"1280\" />\nOlivie Blake will be at Third Place Books Lake Forest Park Tuesday,
  October 28. MICHELLE TERRIS\n\n<p>(BOOKS) I’m very much here for the recent influx
  of dark feminist fiction about female appetites (e.g., <em>Woman, Eating</em>; <em>A
  Certain Hunger</em>; <em>Hungerstone</em>), so I was instantly hooked by the premise
  of <em>The Atlas Six</em> author Olivie Blake’s new novel, <em>Girl Dinner</em>.
  College sophomore Nina Kaur is accepted into The House, the most sought-after sorority
  on campus. Meanwhile, adjunct professor Dr. Sloane Hartley, who is struggling to
  manage her career alongside the travails of new motherhood and a less-than-supportive
  husband, becomes the mysterious society’s new academic liaison. Soon, the two women
  find themselves pulled progressively deeper into an uncanny world of cannibalistic
  rituals and feminine rage. Blake will discuss her book with local speculative fiction
  writer Isabel Cañas, author of <em>The Possession of Alba Díaz</em>. (<em>Third
  Place Books Lake Forest Park, 7 pm, all ages</em>) JULIANNE BELL</p>\n\n<strong>WEDNESDAY
  10/29</strong> <a href=\"#Oct29\"><em> </em></a>\n<p><a href=\"https://everout.com/seattle/events/shrew/e203965/\"><strong>Shrew</strong></a></p>\n<img

  width=\"1080\" />\n\n\n<p>(THEATER) We can all agree that Shakespeare is mad queer
  to begin with, but Union Arts Center’s Shrew really got the brief. This reimagining
  of <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> is almost completely true to the original script,
  but through costuming, blocking, and performance, director Bobbin Ramsey tells the
  story that we all hope ol’ Bill was trying to get at in the first place. Most of
  the male roles are played in drag. And in case you were wondering how Ramsey felt
  about the minor male characters vying for ownership of our female leads, several
  of them are played by the same hand puppet passed around by the actors in drag.
  This is the first Shakespearean play the theater has done since ACT Theatre and
  Seattle Shakespeare joined forces to create Union Arts Center, and came out with
  a bang. This is not Shrew a la <em>10 Things I Hate About You</em> (though if you
  listen closely, you’ll catch a few references to it). This is a Shrew for 2025,
  one where the Shrew is never tamed, and the patriarchy is a nightmare for everyone,
  not just her. (<em>Union Arts Center, through November 2</em>) HANNAH MURPHY WINTER</p>\n\n<strong>THURSDAY

  CREAMER MICHAEL OCHS ARCHIVES/GETTY IMAGES\n\n<p>(BOOKS) Even if you have not read
  Pamela Des Barres’s 1987 memoir, <em>I’m With the Band: Confessions of a Groupie</em>,
  I promise you’ve seen its mark on pop culture (see: Cameron Crowe’s <em>Almost Famous</em>).
  Along with being a best-selling author and the original “rockstar girlfriend,” Des
  Barres was also a member of all-female performance art troupe the GTOs (Girls Together
  Outrageously), who released the incredible experimental rock album <em>Permanent
  Damage</em>, produced by Frank Zappa, back in 1969. Des Barres will bring her one-woman
  show to the Rabbit Box to share her wit, wisdom, and firsthand experiences with
  everyone from Mick Jagger to the Manson Family. (<em>Rabbit Box Theatre, 8 pm, 21+</em>)

  drag icon, recording artist, and <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race All Stars</em> winner Shea
  Couleé is embarking on their first-ever headline DJ tour and bringing a “Halloween-inspired
  celebration of fantasy and fierce beats” to six different cities, and Seattle is
  lucky enough to host their tour stop on actual Halloween. Famed Chicago DJ MISTER
  WALLACE will join them, as will their drag sisters Kerri Colby, Aja, and Luxx Noir
  London. According to Shea, costumes are “not just encouraged, but expected,” so
  be sure to serve “dark glamour meets  ’90s nostalgia” to avoid having to sashay
  away—there might just be a prize awarded for the most sickening look. (<em>Showbox,

  Catrinas Festival is <em>back</em> with a vibrant tribute to the ancestors and Mexican
  tradition featuring music, folklore, and a towering altar adorned with flowers and <em>ofrendas</em>
  (offerings). Inspired by La Catrina (aka the iconic skeleton figure of Día de Muertos),
  this fest hosts live catrinas and catrines in full costume for an impressive living
  procession. Families are invited to bring photos and mementos of loved ones and
  enjoy a bustling street market with traditional food, crafts, art, face painting,
