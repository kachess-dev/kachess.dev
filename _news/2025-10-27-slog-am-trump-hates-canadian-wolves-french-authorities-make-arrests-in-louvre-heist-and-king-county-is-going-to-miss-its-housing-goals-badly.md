  over the weekend that SNAP benefits are officially halting on November 1, thanks
  to the government shutdown. The Trump administration had already announced that
  it wouldn’t dip into the $5 billion they have in backup funds to keep the SNAP program
  moving—a program that helps one in eight families in the US buy groceries. The party
  of family values, ladies and gents. </p>\n            <p><strong>That Government
  Shutdown Is on Day 26: </strong>Want to know how I know that? Because Donald Trump
  put a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/government-shutdown-clock/\">Shutdown
  Clock</a> on the White House’s website. Flights to LAX were temporarily <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/lax-airport-flights-delays-shutdown-b2e0c13f3241e415784c3118fc8f0c9d\">halted</a>
  yesterday because of staffing shortages with air traffic controllers, who have been
  working without pay for 26 days. O’Hare, Newark, Reagan, and Teteboro had similar
  staffing issues this weekend. <em>Real World </em>contestant, competitive lumberjack,
  and current US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said it’s “a sign that the controllers
  are wearing thin.” Give us healthcare, and everyone gets their salaries back. </p>\n<p><strong>The
  ICE Crackdown in Chicago Keeps Getting Worse: </strong>And they’re <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/immigration-arrests-chicago-politicians-trump-7624ff7cae0b58f9b8606deacffa2474\">crossing
  over</a> into local politics. Last week, immigration officers pulled over a Democratic
  Illinois state lawmaker, tried to break his car window, and pulled a gun on him
  before letting him go with a warning for going door to door to alert residents that
  ICE was in the area. The next day, at least four US citizens were detained by ICE
  in the city’s largely Mexican neighborhood, Little Village, including two staffers
  for a city Alderman. And Trump is still threatening to jail the Illinois governor
  and Chicago’s mayor. They’re all scare tactics, but what Trump might not have considered?
  Illinois has an unusual number of congressional seats up for the election next year,
  and the state’s Dems are using this chaos in their campaigns to retake the House. </p>\n<p><strong>Freedom
  Wolves: </strong>After melting down over a Canadian ad over his tariffs, Trump now
  <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/colorado-wolves-reintroduction-canada-fish-wildlife-service-918e3f389fd0de018ccc39d9a99dfdf5\">doesn’t
  want Colorado to import</a> Canadian grey wolves into the state as part of their
  ongoing effort to repopulate the area with the apex predator. They now have to pull
  from wolf populations in the Northern Rockies, which isn’t a realistic option. But
  at least we won’t have any of those socialist wolves in our midst. </p>\n<p><strong>Trump
  2028: </strong>To try to get around constitutional term limits, MAGA supporters
  have floated the idea that Trump could run as VP in 2028, with the understanding
  that the lead on the ticket would step down on day one. On Monday morning, Trump
  <a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/business/trump-rules-out-vp-gambit-but-would-love-to-run-for-third-term/\">told
  reporters</a> he doesn’t plan to try to run that gambit because that would be “too
  cute.” But he’d “love” to run for a third term. </p>\n<p><strong>In Probably Unrelated

  that <em>The Stranger</em> conducted with DHM Research, we know that the mayor’s
  race is all about turnout. When we polled the general population, Katie Wilson had
  a 12-point lead, but when we asked only likely voters, that lead shrank down to
  a statistical tie (she was still four points ahead, but the margin of error was
  4.9 percent). What does that mean? Everyone has to get out there and vote. </p>\n<p><strong>So
  have you voted? </strong>No? Go get your ballot right now. Dig it out of your pile
  of mail and vote. And if you’re not registered yet, here’s how you can vote anyway.

  he knows where it is. “We have a lot of evidence to go on, and I believe the chances
  are 9 out of 10 that it’s Amelia’s plane, but we won’t know until we go in there
  and take a look at it,” he said. On November 4, his team of 14 explorers leave for
  a tiny, remote island halfway between Australia and Hawaii called Nikumaroro in
  hopes that they’ll be the ones to find her long-lost plane.</p>\n<p><strong>King
