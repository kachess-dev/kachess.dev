original_content: "The Stranger's morning news roundup. by Hannah Murphy Winter\n\n**Good
  morning!&nbsp;** We have a break from all the _weather_ today. Expect some sun.
  Temps in the 50s. Not a drop of rain. The works.&nbsp;\n\n**Speaking of Weather:**
  I hope your power is on. After we got walloped by a rain and windstorm on Saturday
  night, trees came down and took powerlines with them. At its peak, more than 310,000
  households lost power, and as of Sunday evening, more than 100,000 of them were
  [still in the dark](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/power-restoration-continues-after-heavy-western-washington-windstorm/?utm_source=marketingcloud&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=TSA_102625222753+Power+returns+for+many+across+WA_10_26_2025&utm_term=Active%2520subscriber).
  Most of the Puget Sound region is back up and running this morning, but if you’re
  one of the unlucky ones, today should be your [last day](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/weather/power-outages-in-western-wa-when-17000-customers-will-get-power-back/?utm_source=marketingcloud&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Morning+Brief+10-27-25_10_27_2025&utm_term=)
  lighting candles and plugging your phone in at the local coffee shop.&nbsp;\n\n**Support
  Your Local Food Pantry:** They’re gonna need it. The USDA [announced](https://apnews.com/article/food-aid-government-shutdown-snap-trump-democrats-8a52a63b26a707ea676962226b090bb1)
  over the weekend that SNAP benefits are officially halting on November 1, thanks
  to the government shutdown. The Trump administration had already announced that
  it wouldn’t dip into the $5 billion they have in backup funds to keep the SNAP program
  moving—a program that helps one in eight families in the US buy groceries. The party
  of family values, ladies and gents.&nbsp;\n\n**That Government Shutdown Is on Day
  26:** Want to know how I know that? Because Donald Trump put a [Shutdown Clock](https://www.whitehouse.gov/government-shutdown-clock/)
  on the White House’s website. Flights to LAX were temporarily [halted](https://apnews.com/article/lax-airport-flights-delays-shutdown-b2e0c13f3241e415784c3118fc8f0c9d)
  yesterday because of staffing shortages with air traffic controllers, who have been
  working without pay for 26 days. O’Hare, Newark, Reagan, and Teteboro had similar
  staffing issues this weekend. _Real World_ contestant, competitive lumberjack, and
  current US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said it’s “a sign that the controllers
  are wearing thin.” Give us healthcare, and everyone gets their salaries back.&nbsp;\n\n**The
  ICE Crackdown in Chicago Keeps Getting Worse:** And they’re [crossing over](https://apnews.com/article/immigration-arrests-chicago-politicians-trump-7624ff7cae0b58f9b8606deacffa2474)
  into local politics. Last week, immigration officers pulled over a Democratic Illinois
  state lawmaker, tried to break his car window, and pulled a gun on him before letting
  him go with a warning for going door to door to alert residents that ICE was in
  the area. The next day, at least four US citizens were detained by ICE in the city’s
  largely Mexican neighborhood, Little Village, including two staffers for a city
  Alderman. And Trump is still threatening to jail the Illinois governor and Chicago’s
  mayor. They’re all scare tactics, but what Trump might not have considered? Illinois
  has an unusual number of congressional seats up for the election next year, and
  the state’s Dems are using this chaos in their campaigns to retake the House.&nbsp;\n\n**Freedom
  Wolves:** After melting down over a Canadian ad over his tariffs, Trump now [doesn’t
  want Colorado to import](https://apnews.com/article/colorado-wolves-reintroduction-canada-fish-wildlife-service-918e3f389fd0de018ccc39d9a99dfdf5)
  Canadian grey wolves into the state as part of their ongoing effort to repopulate
  the area with the apex predator. They now have to pull from wolf populations in
  the Northern Rockies, which isn’t a realistic option. But at least we won’t have
  any of those socialist wolves in our midst.&nbsp;\n\n**Trump 2028:** To try to get
  around constitutional term limits, MAGA supporters have floated the idea that Trump
  could run as VP in 2028, with the understanding that the lead on the ticket would
  step down on day one. On Monday morning, Trump [told reporters](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/trump-rules-out-vp-gambit-but-would-love-to-run-for-third-term/)
  he doesn’t plan to try to run that gambit because that would be “too cute.” But
  he’d “love” to run for a third term.&nbsp;\n\n**In Probably Unrelated News:** He’d
  [really like to meet](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/trump-open-to-extending-asia-trip-to-meet-with-kim-jong-un/?utm_source=marketingcloud&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Morning+Brief+10-27-25_10_27_2025&utm_term=)
  with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un while he’s in Asia this week.&nbsp;\n\n**Election
  Day Is Coming:** And based on the [polling](https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-polling/2025/10/23/80294921/the-polling-is-in-seattle-wants-to-elect-progressives-this-fall)
  that _The Stranger_ conducted with DHM Research, we know that the mayor’s race is
  all about turnout. When we polled the general population, Katie Wilson had a 12-point
  lead, but when we asked only likely voters, that lead shrank down to a statistical
  tie (she was still four points ahead, but the margin of error was 4.9 percent).
  What does that mean? Everyone has to get out there and vote.&nbsp;\n\n**So have
  you voted?** No? Go get your ballot right now. Dig it out of your pile of mail and
  vote. And if you’re not registered yet, here’s how you can vote anyway. Not sure
  who to vote for? We’ve got you: the [version](https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/10/17/80286641/the-strangers-general-election-2025-voting-guide)

  [version](https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/10/17/80286680/the-stranger-election-control-boards-general-election-cheat-sheet)
  for people who just like to be told what to do. And remember, USPS has [new postmarking
  rules](https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/10/23/80295043/an-idiot-proof-guide-to-mailing-in-your-ballot-registering-to-vote-and-changing-your-address)
  that means you’re not guaranteed a day-of postmark, so put it in a ballot drop box,
  not in the mail.&nbsp;\n\n**Why Are You Still Reading?** Go vote.&nbsp;\n\nOkay,
  if you’re still here, I’m assuming your ballot is already safely in a ballot box.
  I’m trusting you.\n\n**Area Man Tries to Get Famous on the Back of a Woman’s Accomplishments:**
  More than 88 years after Amelia Earhart and her plane went down somewhere over the
  Pacific, Oregon archeologist Richard Pettigrew [thinks](https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/researchers-90-sure-theyll-find-amelia-earharts-plane-on-remote-island/)
  he knows where it is. “We have a lot of evidence to go on, and I believe the chances
  are 9 out of 10 that it’s Amelia’s plane, but we won’t know until we go in there
  and take a look at it,” he said. On November 4, his team of 14 explorers leave for
  a tiny, remote island halfway between Australia and Hawaii called Nikumaroro in
  hopes that they’ll be the ones to find her long-lost plane.\n\n**King County Drops
  the Ball on Housing:** The County Council commissioned an analysis of their progress
  to reach their housing goal: 308,677 new homes between 2019 and 2044, half of which
  would be affordable housing. According to the [report](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/real-estate/king-county-falling-behind-in-affordable-housing-push/?utm_source=marketingcloud&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=TSA_102725150008+King+County+falls+short+on+housing+goals_10_27_2025&utm_term=Active%2520subscriber),
  the County would need to scrounge up another $4 billion a year to meet those goals.
  If it stays at the pace it’s going right now, we’ll only build about a third of
  it.&nbsp;\n\n**There’s New Evidence in the CHOP Shooting:** The wrongful death lawsuit
  that Antonio Mays Jr.’s father filed against the City of Seattle is headed to trial
  next week, and new video contradicts the City’s prevailing narrative of what happened
  in the minutes before the Black 16-year-old from Los Angeles was shot. You can read
  the _Seattle Times_’s four-part breakdown of the evidence [here](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/new-seattle-chop-videos-contradict-citys-narratives-on-teen-death/).&nbsp;\n\n**KING
  5 Can’t Handle the Spice:** That’s the only reason we can think of that they spent
  a whole news segment on unpermitted pop-up food trucks. Like Micah [mentioned](https://www.thestranger.com/slog-am/2025/10/23/80294627/slog-am-the-feds-move-into-the-bay-area-trump-pardons-his-crypto-bro-ex-student-sues-the-seattle-school-district)
  on Friday, King County public health officials shut down [17 unpermitted food vendors](https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/seattle/public-health-closes-13-unpermitted-food-vendors-operating-lumen-field-seattle/281-cbc51573-9b7c-4cd5-a228-87e95a1139ea)
  selling around Lumen Field during the Seahawks game last week, and Snohomish County
  is juggling a wash of complaints as well. The only person complaining in the news
  segment? A food truck competitor who _did_ pay for his permits, and he’s grumpy
  about it. It’s worth watching the news segment just for the comments, though.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>

  almost 5 million pounds of frozen, boneless chicken because customers were finding
  metal in the meat. The chicken was sold to food service companies, not directly
  to consumers, so you don’t have to go digging in your freezer unless you own a restaurant,
  hotel, or cafeteria.&nbsp;\n\n**Louvre Robbers Roped:** French officials [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/world/europe/louvre-heist-arrests.html?campaign_id=9&emc=edit_nn_20251026&instance_id=165172&nl=the-morning®i_id=274268112&segment_id=209345&user_id=f913dfab4088e2260a13bdcbb9f89a97)
  that they’ve made arrests in the motorized ladder-based jewelry heist that shocked
  Paris and delighted everyone else. Details are light: officials haven’t said if
  they arrested all four of the people who escaped via scooter after the heist, nor
  did they say whether or not the jewels were on them when they were arrested. Experts
  say the investigators are racing to find the jewels before they remove the gems
  and melt down the precious metals.&nbsp;\n\n**A Song for Your Monday:** For no particular

A severe windstorm in the Puget Sound region caused power outages, affecting over 310,000 households. The government shutdown has led to the halting of SNAP benefits, affecting one in eight US families. The shutdown has also resulted in staffing shortages for air traffic controllers, causing flight delays. The ICE crackdown in Chicago has escalated, with immigration officers interfering in local politics. Despite controversy, Trump supporters have suggested he could run for VP in 2028 to bypass term limits. Meanwhile, King County is falling behind in its affordable housing goals. A wrongful death lawsuit against the City of Seattle for the CHOP shooting is going to trial with new video evidence that contradicts the city's narrative. French authorities have made arrests in the Louvre heist.
