original_content: "Three city workers have had the full \"Bruce Harrell experience.\"
  They're done. by Ryan Driscoll\n\nMayor Bruce Harrell likes to remind Seattle that
  he brings “experience” to the job, but experience alone does not guarantee effective
  leadership. Captain E.J. Smith boasted years of experience before he hit the iceberg
  that sank the _Titanic_. Four years in the White House did not make Donald Trump
  “presidential.” Andrew Cuomo’s “experience” as New York’s governor doesn’t automatically
  make him the right person to lead New York City at this moment.\n\nAs city workers
  who have collectively served for more than 30 years at Seattle City Light, Parks
  and Recreation, and the Office for Civil Rights, we have had the “Harrell experience.”
  His leadership demoralized the workforce, shrank services, and left city departments
  too paralyzed to meet the needs of our communities.\n\n**Ryan Driscoll, Seattle
  Office for Civil Rights**\n\nSeattle’s Office for Civil Rights should be leading
  the charge to protect residents from discrimination, especially now as the federal
  government rolls back protections for immigrants, transgender people, and people
  with disabilities. But Mayor Harrell’s refusal to fix the city’s structural budget
  deficit means our office is consistently being asked to do more with less. Managers
  are focused on justifying their team’s work to prevent cuts, we delay hiring positions
  to save money, and there are no resources to expand our services despite increasing
  needs.&nbsp;\n\nFor us, that has meant our investigators who look into civil rights
  violations have increasing case loads and less capacity to support our proactive
  work. Next year, for instance, we’ll do less engagement at community events where
  we inform residents of Seattle’s antidiscrimination laws. These conversations matter.
  They educate renters about our [first in time law](https://www.seattle.gov/rentinginseattle/renters/are-you-ready-to-rent/first-in-time),
  help small businesses and landlords know how to [interact with service animals](https://www.seattle.gov/documents/departments/civilrights/enforcement/23_0915_socr_serviceanimals_pamphlet_final.pdf),
  and tell our gay and trans neighbors that they’re still protected in Seattle.&nbsp;\n\nSeattle’s
  residents deserve a mayor who is willing to push for a long-term solution to our
  budget issues and fully fund the programs that support our residents. Instead, we
  have seen a mayor who relies on stopgap measures that leave city departments under-resourced.&nbsp;\n\n**George
  Moffitt, Seattle Parks and Recreation**\n\nI’ve worked for the Parks Department
  for 26 years. I started as a teenage lifeguard at Meadowbrook Pool, where I now
  serve as assistant coordinator. Our department has been in decline for over 15 years,
  and Mayor Harrell’s administration has accelerated the process. Facilities are aging,
  maintenance crews are stretched thin, and he seems to have fostered a culture that
  makes the department so afraid of making mistakes that nobody makes decisions. It’s
  not just a problem. It’s _the_ problem, and morale is on the floor.\n\nAs Ryan mentioned,
  Harrell’s failure to fix the budget deficit leaves staffing brittle. If someone
  calls out sick or takes a day off, then the extra work our frontline staff must
  do to maintain the programs Seattle deserves pushes us to the brink, leading to
  burnout and excessive overtime. When we do receive small staffing boosts, they at
  best bring us back to the same levels of being overworked.\n\nI want a leader who
  can see how departments can function better and take action. I haven’t seen that
  from Harrell; I’ve only seen our systems decay.\n\n**Brian Taubeneck, Seattle City
  Light**\n\nIf Harrell truly wanted to make government work efficiently, he’d listen
  to the people who do the work. Instead, he ignores us. I’ve worked for City Light
  for nearly six years. When Harrell ordered employees back to the office, we’d gotten
  an email, but I learned about it in a newspaper. Apparently, this major change to
  our daily lives did not merit a discussion.\n\nReasonable people can disagree on
  the merits of city workers serving the public from home or from a downtown office
  building, but everyone can agree that imposing a massive change to working conditions
  without consulting the workers is just bad management.\n\nInternal staff surveys
  showed that 85 percent of City Light office staff preferred to work 1 day or less
  per week in office. Staff reported seeing benefits to their mental health, savings
  on time and money from having no commutes, and more productivity for providing city
  services. My mental health was better, I saved time on my commute, and I saved money
  making lunch at home.  \n  \nIf Harrell wanted us back in the office to support
  struggling downtown businesses and collaborate with our colleagues, he should have
  at least talked to us about it. But he didn't. He made a backroom deal with downtown
  business interests and then spun up a story about productivity that he didn’t back
  up with data.\n\nThis demoralized the workforce. Many of us felt as if we were working
  for an administration that valued appearances more than outcomes.\n\nThe pattern
  seems pretty clear across the Office of Civil Rights, Parks and Recreation, City
  Light, and other departments. Harrell’s “experience” has produced paralysis where
  we need progress, austerity where we need investment, and paternalism where we need
  partnership.\n\nSeattle deserves a mayor who sees city workers as allies, not obstacles,
  someone willing to confront structural problems and act. Every day we maintain Harrell’s
  status quo, Seattle residents pay the price in the form of slower services, less
  safety, and a government too afraid or uninterested to act.\n\n_The views expressed
  here are those of the authors in their personal capacities and do not represent
  the official positions of their departments or the City of Seattle_.\n\n**_Ryan

Mayor Bruce Harrell's "experience" has been critiqued by three city workers from Seattle City Light, Parks and Recreation, and the Office for Civil Rights. They argue that his leadership has caused a demoralized workforce, shrunken services, and paralyzed city departments. His refusal to address the city's structural budget deficit has caused departmental resources to dwindle, affecting civil rights investigations and community engagement. His decision to bring employees back to the office was reportedly made without consultation, despite surveys showing that 85% of City Light office staff preferred to work at home. His tenure has been marked by perceived paralysis, austerity, and paternalism, leading to slower services, less safety, and a hesitant government.
