Argentine assets, including international bonds and local stocks, have seen a significant rise following the election victory of the libertarian Milei Party. The peso has also strengthened against the US dollar. The Milei Party, which criticizes the country's extensive state intervention, is expected to push for more market-friendly policies, causing this positive reaction in the financial markets. The party's impact will be watched closely given Argentina's economic challenges, which include high inflation, a large fiscal deficit, and debt restructuring talks with the International Monetary Fund.
