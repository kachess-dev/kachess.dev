  The nostalgic Steel Cotton Rail Trail between Sheffield and Manchester has 14 day-length sections, with walks for urban explorers and summit-bagging hikers alike

  The Pride of Cumbria train carried me out of Piccadilly station and, eventually, beyond built-up Manchester. After Marple, everything turned green as the valleys narrowed. It was a classic northern autumn day: the clouds were low, the mizzle and mist were closing in and the world was grey-filtered but for the glow of dead leaves all around.

  South-east of Manchester is a bit of an unknown for me. Between the city and the Derbyshire borough of High Peak, you don’t quite enter national park territory, but it’s nonetheless a charming and eye-calming landscape. The [Mancunian Kinder Scout trespassers of 1932](https://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/learning-about/news/70-years-of-the-peak-district-national-park/the-mass-trespass) probably came this way, as do Pennine Way-farers bound for Edale. But the region is also post-industrial and close to conurbations. The Steel Cotton Rail Trail, which [officially launched earlier this month](https://peakdistrictbytrain.org/scrt_launch/) after several years of planning, hopes to bring together elements of the land and the heritage while also drawing walkers and cyclists to areas of the Peak District perhaps ignored by those who rush for the main spine of the Pennines.

The Steel Cotton Rail Trail, a newly launched attraction between Sheffield and Manchester, offers 14 day-length sections for both urban explorers and avid hikers. The trail provides a journey through the charming landscapes southeast of Manchester, leading to the Derbyshire borough of High Peak. It aims to unite elements of the land's heritage, drawing visitors to parts of the Peak District typically overlooked by those heading for the Pennines. The trail is part of a post-industrial region near urban areas, serving as a tribute to the Mancunian Kinder Scout trespassers of 1932 and the Pennine Way-farers.
