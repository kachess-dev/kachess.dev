  Arsenal’s title tilt is built on solid defence, Chelsea miss Cole Palmer and what happened to clampdown on shirt-pulling?

  “One-nil to the Arsenal” may not be thrilling but it is certainly effective. Sunday’s victory over Crystal Palace was Mikel Arteta’s side’s third by that margin in nine Premier League games. Last season, Arsenal managed that result five times in the league, while also drawing 1-1 in seven matches. Clean sheets in just half of those might have made for an intriguing title race. For all the noise surrounding Arsenal’s attacking talent, their defence is just as vital. It is their solidity at that end of the pitch that will probably lead them to glory, with three goals conceded in nine top-flight games so far. Sunday also marked a century of games across all competitions since they have conceded more than twice. The last to put three past David Raya?

Arsenal's effective defence strategy, marked by a third 1-0 victory in nine Premier League games, is building a strong case for their title contention. Despite the focus on Arsenal's attacking talent, their defensive prowess has been pivotal, with only three goals conceded in nine top-flight games. This marks a century of games across all competitions since they conceded more than twice. Meanwhile, Chelsea is feeling the absence of Cole Palmer, and questions are being raised about the lack of a clampdown on shirt-pulling in the sport.
