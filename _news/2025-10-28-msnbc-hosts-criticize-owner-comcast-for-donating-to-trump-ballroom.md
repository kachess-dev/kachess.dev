Rachel Maddow, MSNBC's top host, publicly criticised parent company Comcast for financially supporting the White House's costly East Wing ballroom construction project. The White House recently disclosed a list of 37 corporations and individual donors, including Google and Apple, that have contributed to the $300m project.
