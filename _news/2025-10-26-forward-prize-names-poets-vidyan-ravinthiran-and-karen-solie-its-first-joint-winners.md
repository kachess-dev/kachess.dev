  Judge of prestigious award says two best collection winners ‘address the urgent challenges of our time’

  Vidyan Ravinthiran and Karen Solie have been named joint winners of this year’s Forward prize for best collection, one of the UK’s most prestigious poetry awards, marking the first time in the prize’s history the honour has been shared.

  Ravinthiran, who was born in Leeds to Sri Lankan Tamil parents and now lives in the US, was recognised for Avidyā. The collection is described as having emerged from “journeys of great personal significance, and out of a migrant sensibility tied to three different countries”.

Vidyan Ravinthiran and Karen Solie are the first joint winners of the Forward prize for best collection, a highly respected UK poetry award. Ravinthiran, a Sri Lankan Tamil now living in the US, won for his collection 'Avidyā', derived from personal journeys and a migrant sensibility tied to three countries. Solie, a Canadian poet, shared the award for 'Wellwater', a self-reflective dialogue with a culture in crisis and an endangered natural world. This is the first time in the prize's history that the honor has been shared.
