  Forget Halloween! Real scares can happen to actors any night of the year. Big name performers, including Zachary Hart and Harmony Rose-Bremner, recall their worst moments – and how they overcame their fears

Stage fright is a common fear among actors regardless of their level of experience. Renowned performers like Zachary Hart, Harmony Rose-Bremner, Derek Jacobi, Bill Nighy, and Juliet Stevenson have all experienced it. Some, like Stephen Fry and Lenny Henry, were even forced to leave the stage mid-performance due to this fear. Stage fright can cause shaking, physical freezing, or verbal stumbling. It's been likened to a disease due to its capacity to completely immobilize actors. Despite its prevalence, actors have found ways to overcome it and continue delivering compelling performances.
