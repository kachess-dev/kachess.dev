See someone? Say something! by Anonymous

**Vibing at ALDS game 1**

I was on the aisle of 345. You were on the aisle of 344. We shared some vibes every time something positive happened. Let’s keep the vibes going?

**Saturday Secret Beach Babe Soaking Up The Sun**

You: black swimsuit, koi fish tattoo. Me: deep in a book, black shorts. We shared a few glances as the steamboat went by. Meet at the beach this week?

**Oddfellows 10/8 between noon and 1**

Your Hotness with black bangs with a friend (east) wall row of tables near the windows - I was sitting alone reading on the south wall - hmu -

**Good guy in Ballard 10/5**

Man at Market+ Leary in Ballard 10/5 6:30 PM. You were giving shoes and socks to a homeless man. Wanted to say thanks for treating him like a person.

**Magnuson man bun**

You have the sweetest tan puppy w/ bright caramel eyes, her flower dog tag even matched my pup’s. You’re tatted, glasses, blonde. Dog date?

**jigitz make out sesh**

My crew was hovering behind your crew at jigitz. We vibed and then I suggested we make out, a couple times, and it was a treat. Lost you after lights

**Noise artist at potluck**

In Beacon Hill. You were in town from Bellingham visiting a friend. We talked about noise music. I hope I can get off work to see you play at brunch.
