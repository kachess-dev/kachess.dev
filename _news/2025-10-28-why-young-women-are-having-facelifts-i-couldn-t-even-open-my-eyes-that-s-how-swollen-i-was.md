  A new kind of customer is being driven towards this invasive surgery by ‘filler fatigue’, the use of weight-loss drugs and the development of new surgical techniques. Many are much younger than ever before

Amanda Preisinger, a 30-year-old real estate agent, underwent six cosmetic procedures, including an endoscopic mid-facelift. Although her new, albeit temporary, look is startlingly lifted and swollen, she reassures that it is not painful. This escalation in younger individuals resorting to invasive surgery highlights the pressure to conform to societal beauty standards and raises concerns about the long-term physical and psychological implications.
