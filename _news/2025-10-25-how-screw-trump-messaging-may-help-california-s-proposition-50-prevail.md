  Republican opposition to the effort to give House Democrats more safe seats may be no match for the fact that Californians really don’t like Trump

  There are many ways to characterize Proposition 50, the single ballot initiative that [Californians](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california) will be voting on this election season.

The initiative's success may be bolstered by Californians' widespread dislike for Trump, potentially overcoming Republican opposition.
