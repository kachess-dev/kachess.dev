  I was obsessed with the _I Love the [insert decade here]_ series of VH1 specials
  that aired constantly in the mid-2000s and offered a window into the absurdity and
  history of past decades. Internet personality and comedian Rob Anderson first transformed
  this style of deep-dive nostalgic comedy into successful TikToks, and now he’s developed
  those into a full live stage show complete with video, songs, and pop culture factoids.
  Anderson seeks to answer ever-looming questions like, “What did our unhinged media
  from this decade teach us about teenage pregnancy, drug addiction, and questionable
  age gaps?” A LOT, it turns out. (_Crocodile, 7 pm [sold out] & 9:30 pm, 21+_) BRI

  One of the first and best podcasts to capitalize on the nation's obsession with
  true crime,&nbsp;_My Favorite Murder_ has been investigating cold cases and telling
  the stories of victims since 2016. Hosts Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark have
  built a dedicated fan base of Murderinos with the convivial sign-off “stay sexy,
  and don’t get murdered.” It’s bullseye if you obsessively watch reruns of _Law &
  Order: Special Victims Unit_, _Cold Case Files_, and the like. This is the duo’s
  first tour in almost six years, so miss it at your own peril. (_Paramount Theatre,

  & DRINK) Over the course of her career, legendary&nbsp;_New York Times_–bestselling
  cookbook author Dorie Greenspan has won five James Beard Awards, collaborated with
  Julia Child, and developed thousands of recipes. In her new cookbook, _Dorie’s Anytime
  Cakes_, the culinary grande dame turns her attention to simple, effortless cakes
  that can be whipped up with pantry staples at a moment’s notice, from “BFF brownie
  cake” to buttermilk plum cake. She’ll stop by Fremont Abbey for a conversation with
  food writer Nancy Leson, followed by a Q&A and book signing. Bonus: Cake will be
  provided in celebration of Dorie’s birthday week. (_Fremont Abbey, 7 pm_) JULIANNE

  Birch and the Unreasonables**](https://everout.com/seattle/events/miki-berenyi-trio/e202788/)\n\n(MUSIC)
  If you are a jazz dude and not familiar with this mysterious trio, don’t worry,
  your ego and masculinity aren’t tarnished! The Miki Berenyi Trio isn’t really a
  jazz trio at all, but a dream-pop supergroup consisting of Lush’s Miki Berenyi,
  Moose’s Kevin McKillop, and Aircooled’s Oliver Cherer. The ensemble’s debut,&nbsp;_Tripla_,
  is a richly layered kaleidoscope of trip-hop, dance music, shoegaze, and ’90s rock.
  Berenyi’s immediately recognizable voice meditates on the disrespect of Mother Earth
  (“8th Deadly Sin”), toxic masculinity (“Big I Am”), and misogyny spread on social
  media (“Grango”). Although the subject matter is often dark, the album is actually
  quite joyful. I suspect it will sound amazing live. And don’t you dare miss an opening
  set from feminist post-punk icon Gina Birch (of the Raincoats) and her new band,
  the Unreasonables. (_Neptune Theatre, 8 pm, all ages_) AUDREY VANN\n\n**FRIDAY 10/24**

  ART) In an era of screens, filters, and AI-generated… everything, what does real
  intimacy look like? Seattle Art Source invites you to explore this topic at an evening
  of conversation and contemplation with artists Barry Johnson, Kyler Pahang, and
  Kade Marsili, moderated by curator Seth Sexton. As part of the _Form Over Function_
  exhibition (on view through November 8), this panel explores how artists interpret
  the human form and the closeness it conveys in a hyper-digital age. If you missed
  last week’s panel on “Emergence,” this is your chance to join a thoughtful discussion
  and to engage directly with the exhibition's creators (no algorithm required). (_Seattle
  Art Source, 5 pm, free, all ages_) LANGSTON THOMAS\n\n**SATURDAY 10/25** &nbsp;[_&nbsp;_](#Oct25)\n\n[**Shonen
  Knife, the Pack A.D.**](https://everout.com/seattle/events/shonen-knife-and-osaka-ramones-w-the-pack-a-d/e216232/)\n\n(MUSIC)
  Is there any band cooler than Shonen Knife? The answer is no. Formed in Osaka, Japan,
  in 1981 by two college friends and their younger sister, the band was named after
  a knife marketed to boys, and the trio began writing pop-punk songs about candy,
  animals, and consumerism. They’ve had some lineup changes throughout the years,
  but the current touring band consists of founding sisters Naoko and Atsuko Yamano
  and drummer Risa Kawano (who has been with the band since 2011). Just take it from
  noted Shonen Knife fanboy Kurt Cobain, who once said, “When I finally got to see
  them live, I was transformed into a hysterical 9-year-old girl at a Beatles concert.”
  They will be joined by British garage-rock duo the Pack A.D. for two consecutive
  shows. The late show sold out quickly, so don’t sleep on these tickets! (_Tractor
  Tavern, 4:30 pm & 8:30 pm [sold out], 21+_) AUDREY VANN\n\n**SUNDAY 10/26** &nbsp;[_&nbsp;_](#Oct26)\n\n[**Makaya
  McCraven**](https://everout.com/seattle/events/makaya-mccraven/e206469/)\n\n(MUSIC)
  Chicago-based drummer Makaya McCraven’s riotous Earshot 2022 gig at Nectar had the
  crowd going as wild as a Sun Ra keyboard solo. A key figure in the current jazz
  resurgence as part of the crucial International Anthem label, McCraven shows a keen
  appreciation for the music’s ’60s/’70s avant-garde while adding his own distinctive
  spin with inventive post-production editing and electronic enhancements. His newest
  output consists of four EPs that will be collected under the title&nbsp;_Off the
  Record_ (available on physical formats October 10 and digitally October 31). These
  tracks spawned from live improvisations over the years and then were chopped and
  spiced [_sic_] into the fascinating pieces you hear on record. Each EP has its own
  personality and personnel. _Hidden Out!_ features some of McCraven’s most athletic,
  powerful drumming. The funky “Battleships” slinks in the vein of Mr. Ra’s “Twin
  Stars of Thence,” with spidery guitar filigree by Jeff Parker. _The People’s Mixtape_
  offers polyrhythmic avant-funk that should appeal to open-minded hip-hop fans. _PopUp
  Shop_’s serpentine post-bop jams could’ve earned Blue Note’s stamp of approval back
  in the day. The jaggedly rhythmic and electronics-laced _Techno Logic_, with cornetist
  Ben LaMar Gay and tubaist Theon Cross, represents Makaya’s most experimental material.
  Fortuitously, this studio magic translates to the stage. (_Madame Lou’s, 6 pm &
