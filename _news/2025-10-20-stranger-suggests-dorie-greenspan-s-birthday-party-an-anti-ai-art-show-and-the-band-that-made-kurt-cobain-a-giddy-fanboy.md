  Anderson: Are You Afraid of the '90s</strong></a></p>\n<p>(COMEDY) I was obsessed
  with the <em>I Love the [insert decade here]</em> series of VH1 specials that aired
  constantly in the mid-2000s and offered a window into the absurdity and history
  of past decades. Internet personality and comedian Rob Anderson first transformed
  this style of deep-dive nostalgic comedy into successful TikToks, and now he’s developed
  those into a full live stage show complete with video, songs, and pop culture factoids.
  Anderson seeks to answer ever-looming questions like, “What did our unhinged media
  from this decade teach us about teenage pregnancy, drug addiction, and questionable
  age gaps?” A LOT, it turns out. (<em>Crocodile, 7 pm [sold out] &amp; 9:30 pm, 21+</em>)

  Favorite Murder Live</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(PODCAST) One of the first and
  best podcasts to capitalize on the nation's obsession with true crime, <em>My Favorite
  Murder</em> has been investigating cold cases and telling the stories of victims
  since 2016. Hosts Karen Kilgariff and Georgia Hardstark have built a dedicated fan
  base of Murderinos with the convivial sign-off “stay sexy, and don’t get murdered.”
  It’s bullseye if you obsessively watch reruns of <em>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims
  Unit</em>, <em>Cold Case Files</em>, and the like. This is the duo’s first tour
  in almost six years, so miss it at your own peril. (<em>Paramount Theatre, Tues–Wed,

  &amp; DRINK) Over the course of her career, legendary <em>New York Times</em>–bestselling
  cookbook author Dorie Greenspan has won five James Beard Awards, collaborated with
  Julia Child, and developed thousands of recipes. In her new cookbook, <em>Dorie’s
  Anytime Cakes</em>, the culinary grande dame turns her attention to simple, effortless
  cakes that can be whipped up with pantry staples at a moment’s notice, from “BFF
  brownie cake” to buttermilk plum cake. She’ll stop by Fremont Abbey for a conversation
  with food writer Nancy Leson, followed by a Q&amp;A and book signing. Bonus: Cake
  will be provided in celebration of Dorie’s birthday week. (<em>Fremont Abbey, 7

  Berenyi Trio, Gina Birch and the Unreasonables</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(MUSIC)
  If you are a jazz dude and not familiar with this mysterious trio, don’t worry,
  your ego and masculinity aren’t tarnished! The Miki Berenyi Trio isn’t really a
  jazz trio at all, but a dream-pop supergroup consisting of Lush’s Miki Berenyi,
  Moose’s Kevin McKillop, and Aircooled’s Oliver Cherer. The ensemble’s debut, <em>Tripla</em>,
  is a richly layered kaleidoscope of trip-hop, dance music, shoegaze, and ’90s rock.
  Berenyi’s immediately recognizable voice meditates on the disrespect of Mother Earth
  (“8th Deadly Sin”), toxic masculinity (“Big I Am”), and misogyny spread on social
  media (“Grango”). Although the subject matter is often dark, the album is actually
  quite joyful. I suspect it will sound amazing live. And don’t you dare miss an opening
  set from feminist post-punk icon Gina Birch (of the Raincoats) and her new band,
  the Unreasonables. (<em>Neptune Theatre, 8 pm, all ages</em>) AUDREY VANN</p>\n\n<strong>FRIDAY

  ART) In an era of screens, filters, and AI-generated… everything, what does real
  intimacy look like? Seattle Art Source invites you to explore this topic at an evening
  of conversation and contemplation with artists Barry Johnson, Kyler Pahang, and
  Kade Marsili, moderated by curator Seth Sexton. As part of the <em>Form Over Function</em>
  exhibition (on view through November 8), this panel explores how artists interpret
  the human form and the closeness it conveys in a hyper-digital age. If you missed
  last week’s panel on “Emergence,” this is your chance to join a thoughtful discussion
  and to engage directly with the exhibition's creators (no algorithm required). (<em>Seattle

  Knife, the Pack A.D.</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(MUSIC) Is there any band cooler
  than Shonen Knife? The answer is no. Formed in Osaka, Japan, in 1981 by two college
  friends and their younger sister, the band was named after a knife marketed to boys,
  and the trio began writing pop-punk songs about candy, animals, and consumerism.
  They’ve had some lineup changes throughout the years, but the current touring band
  consists of founding sisters Naoko and Atsuko Yamano and drummer Risa Kawano (who
  has been with the band since 2011). Just take it from noted Shonen Knife fanboy
  Kurt Cobain, who once said, “When I finally got to see them live, I was transformed
  into a hysterical 9-year-old girl at a Beatles concert.” They will be joined by
  British garage-rock duo the Pack A.D. for two consecutive shows. The late show sold
  out quickly, so don’t sleep on these tickets! (<em>Tractor Tavern, 4:30 pm &amp;

  McCraven</strong></a></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>(MUSIC) Chicago-based drummer Makaya McCraven’s
  riotous Earshot 2022 gig at Nectar had the crowd going as wild as a Sun Ra keyboard
  solo. A key figure in the current jazz resurgence as part of the crucial International
  Anthem label, McCraven shows a keen appreciation for the music’s ’60s/’70s avant-garde
  while adding his own distinctive spin with inventive post-production editing and
  electronic enhancements. His newest output consists of four EPs that will be collected
  under the title <em>Off the Record</em> (available on physical formats October 10
  and digitally October 31). These tracks spawned from live improvisations over the
  years and then were chopped and spiced [<em>sic</em>] into the fascinating pieces
  you hear on record. Each EP has its own personality and personnel. <em>Hidden Out!</em>
  features some of McCraven’s most athletic, powerful drumming. The funky “Battleships”
  slinks in the vein of Mr. Ra’s “Twin Stars of Thence,” with spidery guitar filigree
  by Jeff Parker. <em>The People’s Mixtape</em> offers polyrhythmic avant-funk that
  should appeal to open-minded hip-hop fans. <em>PopUp Shop</em>’s serpentine post-bop
  jams could’ve earned Blue Note’s stamp of approval back in the day. The jaggedly
  rhythmic and electronics-laced <em>Techno Logic</em>, with cornetist Ben LaMar Gay
  and tubaist Theon Cross, represents Makaya’s most experimental material. Fortuitously,
  this studio magic translates to the stage. (<em>Madame Lou’s, 6 pm &amp; 9:30 pm,
