original_content: "One really great thing to do every day of the week. by Julianne
  Bell **MONDAY 10/13** &nbsp;[_&nbsp;_](#Oct13)\n\n**[Smerz](https://everout.com/seattle/events/smerz-with-special-guests/e207570/)**\n\n(MUSIC)&nbsp;If
  the idea of two sweetly harmonizing Norwegian women making nonchalantly brilliant
  electronic music doesn’t pique your interest, then you should probably reassess
  your aesthetics. Henriette Motzfeldt and Catharina Stoltenberg have been creating
  interesting and varied electronica since 2018, like a less flamboyant Björk—although
  the intimate, orchestral work of France’s Colleen may be a more accurate touchstone.
  But with this year’s&nbsp;_Big city life_, Smerz take a graceful leap forward with
  their songwriting and arranging skills. They exude that irresistible deadpan cool,
  like Wet Leg, but Smerz come off as more bedroom auteurs than arena-filling entertainers.
  The title track is rock-ribbed, bass-heavy electro-pop with an oh-so-haunting keyboard
  melody. The sassy, methodical electroclash of “Roll the dice” sounds like a more
  understated Peaches. “You got time and I got money” is the lowest-key seduction
  anthem you’ll hear all year and boasts the excellent line “Baby, can I see you naked?
  / Even though I love how you dress.” “But I do” is enchanting, slow-motion funk
  with entrancing vocal harmonies and a killer, subliminal bass line. It’s one of
  the songs of 2025. (Do you know how many songs have been released this year??) (_Hidden

  & DRINK) Samin Nosrat revolutionized the cookbook world in 2017 with her James Beard
  Award–winning manifesto&nbsp;_Salt Fat Acid Heat_, which educates readers on the
  four fundamentals of flavor, so that they can cook well intuitively. (The recipes
  for buttermilk chicken and autumn panzanella are fall staples in my household.)
  She reached a wider audience and charmed viewers with her warmth and gusto on her
  2018 Netflix series of the same name, in which she traveled to various destinations
  to learn more about the four elements. Eight years after the publication of&nbsp;_Salt
  Fat Acid Heat_, her highly anticipated follow-up,&nbsp;_Good Things,_&nbsp;has arrived.
  It contains 125 of Nosrat’s most cherished recipes, from saffron roast chicken to
  nostalgic yellow cake with chocolate frosting, as well as advice, anecdotes about
  her adorable dog Fava, and meditations on how food can nourish community. Samin
  will join her friend, author and former&nbsp;_Stranger_&nbsp;staff food writer Angela
  Garbes, for a conversation about food, creativity, and connection. (_Benaroya Hall,

  Little Foxes’ by Lillian Hellman**](https://everout.com/seattle/events/the-little-foxes/e217903/)\n\n(THEATER)
  Set in a small Alabama town in 1900, Lillian Hellman’s _The Little Foxes_&nbsp;follows
  Regina Giddens as she manipulates her way into receiving a hefty family inheritance
  in an era when sons were considered the only legal heirs. The story is the perfect
  example of how a lack of women’s rights can lead to a multitude of women’s wrongs—it’s
  the ultimate “good for her!” story. Since its original stage production, starring
  Tallulah Bankhead in 1939, the leading role has been revived for stars like Bette
  Davis (in the 1941 film adaptation), Elizabeth Taylor, Stockard Channing, Laura
  Linney, Cynthia Nixon, and more. This group of actresses alone speaks volumes about
  the drama and camp of this theater masterpiece. (_Intiman Theatre, various times

  'A Deeper Love: The Story of Miss Peppermint' at this year's SIFF Doc Fest, which
  runs October 16–23. COURTESY OF SIFF\n\n(FILM) Sure, it’s no Sundance, Cannes, or
  Venice Film Festival, but SIFF’S DocFest is a pretty big deal. In the last five
  years alone, the festival has screened Academy Award nominees like 2022’s&nbsp;_All
  the Beauty and the Bloodshed_&nbsp;and 2021’s&nbsp;_Flee_, as well as premiered
  heavy hitters like&nbsp;_The Sanctity of Space_. This year’s programming is possibly
  the best yet, with highlights like&nbsp;_Sun Ra: Do the Impossible_&nbsp;(about
  the dearly departed Afro-futurist jazz icon),&nbsp;_A Deeper Love: The Story of
  Miss Peppermint_&nbsp;(following the life of the Broadway star and drag royal),
  and&nbsp;_Steal This Story, Please!_&nbsp;(about Democracy Now! journalist Amy Goodman).

  AiR Fun-Raiser Carnival**](https://everout.com/seattle/events/actualize-air-fun-raiser-carnival/e220198/)\n\n(VISUAL
  ART) For the better part of two years, Actualize AiR has hosted a litany of fascinating
  art shows and experiences in the old downtown Seattle Coliseum building, from this
  summer’s Artists Doing: Nothing, a made-in-a-day performance experiment, to [ICONS](https://www.instagram.com/p/DLU_m_kxTcX/),
  a multidisciplinary exhibit from Alissa Dymally Williams and Noelle Whitaker that
  spread throughout several rooms in the partially unfinished basement. But there’s
  bad news for everyone who’s come to love stopping by during downtown’s Fourth Friday
  art walks: Actualize AiR lost their lease. But there’s good news, too! They’ve found
  a new space in Pioneer Square and will move in the coming months. To kick off their
  $40,000 moving cost fundraiser—and as one last goodbye to the Coliseum—Actualize
  AiR are throwing a “fun-raiser” with all your carnival favorites, including face
  painting, caricatures, airbrushed T-shirts, and cotton candy. It’s free, but you
  can buy bingo cards and raffle tickets to help ’em reach their one-night $15,000
  goal. (_The Coliseum, 6 pm, free, all ages_) MEGAN SELING\n\n**SATURDAY 10/18**
  &nbsp;[_&nbsp;_](#Oct18)\n\n[**Pinback**](https://everout.com/seattle/events/grindhaus-with-bosco-alaska-5000-irene-the-alien-mistress-isabelle-brooks/e214747/)\n\n(MUSIC)
  Pinback hasn't released a new album since 2012, but that doesn't stop them from
  playing sporadic shows for their adoring and supportive fanbase. With their unique
  rock-influenced take on indie pop, the duo of Armistead Burwell Smith IV and Rob
  Crow craft complex tracks that have kept listeners engaged for over two decades.
  (Their song \"[Good to Sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1haNJpK1JjQ)\" started
  my obsession with indie music in high school.) Their live shows are always energetic
  affairs, with moshing teenagers and song requests taken via paper airplane. Hasco
  Enjoyments, an instrumental band that describes themselves as \"a musical group
  featuring baritone guitar, flute, synthesizers and saxophones played by an ensemble
  of iridescent bubbles,\" opens the show. The LA-based ensemble has a song called
  \"The Seattle Mariners Are My Favorite Baseball Team,\" and while I'm not entirely
  sure why, I obviously love it. (_The Showbox, 8:30 pm, all ages_) SHANNON LUBETICH\n\n**SUNDAY
  10/19** &nbsp;[_&nbsp;_](#Oct19)\n\n[**'House'**](https://everout.com/seattle/locations/northwest-film-forum/l19643/)\n\n(HALLOWEEN)
  You’ll never forget your first time watching the bananas 1977 Japanese horror-comedy
  technicolor phantasmagoria that is House. The story follows a teen schoolgirl named
  Gorgeous who goes on a summer trip to visit her aunt’s home in the countryside,
  along with her six friends: the brainy Prof, music-loving Melody, athletic Kung
  Fu, perpetually hungry Mac, gentle Sweet, and daydreamer Fantasy. One by one, the
  classmates fall victim to the house’s supernatural traps. This movie has everything:
  a disembodied head biting someone in the ass, a flesh-eating piano, mattresses falling
  from the sky, and an evil white Persian cat named Blanche. Really, it must be seen
  to be believed. Drag queen and self-described “bird-brained bombshell” Monday Mourning
  will give an introduction to the film, which is part of her “Mourning Sickness”
  series of camp and cult classics. (_Northwest Film Forum, 7:30 pm_) JULIANNE BELL"
