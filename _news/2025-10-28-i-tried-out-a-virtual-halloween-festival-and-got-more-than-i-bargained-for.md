  Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival began as a lockdown project and has now become an annual gaming tradition. My children and I paid it a visit

  In an attempt to avoid spending £80 to walk around a local park with my children to see some underwhelming spooky decorations, and having failed for the fifth year in a row to secure a ticket to a Scottish farm to tramp damply around looking at pumpkins, I tried something different with my kids this Halloween: a virtual pumpkin festival.

  [Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival](https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver/devlog/1086225/the-haunting-returns-for-2025) was first created in the depths of the 2020 pandemic, when game developer Adam Robinson-Yu’s real-life neighbourhood pumpkin festival was cancelled. (Yu also made the excellent and equally autumnal [A Short Hike](https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/oct/26/epic-fall-the-joy-of-autumnal-video-games).) Since then, it has returned for a few weeks every year, letting players come together as adorable ghosts to explore a creepy little micro-world filled with player-created pumpkins.

The Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival, a virtual Halloween experience initiated during the 2020 pandemic lockdown, has now become an annual tradition. Created by game developer Adam Robinson-Yu after his real-life pumpkin festival was cancelled, the game allows players to explore a spooky micro-world as adorable ghosts, encountering player-created pumpkins. Every year, the game introduces new features, with a haunted house escape room added in 2024, and a movie theatre playing silent films introduced in 2025. The virtual pumpkin festival offers an alternative, less costly and more immersive Halloween experience for kids and adults alike.
