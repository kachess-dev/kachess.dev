The Louvre in Paris, the world's most visited museum, recently fell victim to a brazen smash-and-grab heist, marking the latest in a long history of audacious art thefts. The article recalls other significant museum heists, such as the 1911 theft of the Mona Lisa and the 1990 Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum theft in Boston, where 13 pieces of art valued at $500 million were stolen. Despite advancements in security technology, the allure of priceless art continues to entice criminals, making museums a constant target. The recovery rate for stolen art is low, with many pieces never resurfacing.
