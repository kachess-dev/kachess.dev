  Somewhere in the US a woman on her period pulled out her dripping, saturated tampon. But instead of wrapping it in toilet paper and tossing it into a bin, she put the tampon in a special plastic sample container, screwed the lid on tight and mailed it to an address in Oakland, California.

  The address was that of NextGen Jane (NGJ), a Bay Area-based startup founded in 2014. And now Julia Carr, NGJ’s clinical research coordinator, stands in the company’s lab under a fume hood happily decanting a mixture of the woman’s blood and a preservation solution into a test tube. She will go on to pipette out small amounts to freeze and store for later analysis. NGJ has obtained about 2,500 menstrual blood samples this way – from women volunteering to send in their used tampons – for its research. That Carr is dealing with their period blood does not gross her out in the slightest. “This is a beautiful project for women’s science, and we are exploring a novel sample type,” she says.

NextGen Jane (NGJ), a Bay Area-based startup, is exploring the use of menstrual blood to test for various health conditions, including endometriosis. The company collects used tampons sent in by female volunteers to analyze the menstrual blood. NGJ's clinical research coordinator, Julia Carr, processes the samples for later analysis. As of the time of the article, the firm has received about 2,500 samples. The initiative aims to redefine perceptions of menstrual blood from being 'stinky and useless' to a valuable resource for women's health research.
