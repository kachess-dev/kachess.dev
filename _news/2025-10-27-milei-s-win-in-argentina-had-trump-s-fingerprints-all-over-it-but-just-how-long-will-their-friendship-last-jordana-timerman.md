  In 1946, Argentina was emerging from military rule, an empowered labour movement was reshaping politics and Col Juan Perón, a leftwing leader who had introduced a raft of popular workers’ rights decrees, was rising fast in the polls. The then US ambassador, Spruille Braden, had other ideas about who should win the national election that year, and he openly campaigned against Perón in Buenos Aires. Braden’s action stands out as one of the most brazen instances of US interference in Argentina’s politics.

Ahead of the congressional elections, Trump endorsed Milei and warned: “If he loses, we are not going to be generous with Argentina.” Washington extended a [$20bn currency swap line](https://www.ft.com/content/815ef487-0d0e-430c-b140-9bc39dbd1a53) to the government – money aimed at stabilising financial volatility that would have undermined Milei’s chances.

Argentinian President, Javier Milei's libertarian experiment is faltering. His hold on power is increasingly reliant on unpredictable US support. Milei, who recently claimed a significant midterm victory, has been backed extensively by Donald Trump. Trump has threatened that if Milei loses, US generosity towards Argentina will decline. To stabilize financial volatility that could threaten Milei's position, Washington has provided a $20bn currency swap line to the government. The US treasury has also directly intervened, purchasing over a billion dollars of pesos to halt the currency's rapid depreciation.
