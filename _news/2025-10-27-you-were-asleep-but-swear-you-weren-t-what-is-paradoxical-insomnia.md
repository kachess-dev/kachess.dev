  We don’t always know when we’re asleep or awake. This can affect how rested we feel

  In 2018, Hannah Scott, a sleep researcher at Flinders University, waited for a woman to fall asleep.

  This can take time when the subject is connected to equipment measuring brain activity, eye movement, heart rate and muscle activation. But about 30 minutes after the woman closed her eyes, Scott saw the telltale signs of sleep from the electroencephalogram, or EEG: a shift to lower-frequency brainwaves.

In 2018, sleep researcher Hannah Scott at Flinders University, studied a woman's sleep process using multiple devices to measure brain activity, eye movement, heart rate, and muscle activation. Approximately 30 minutes after the subject closed her eyes, Scott observed signs of sleep through an electroencephalogram (EEG), which showed a shift to lower-frequency brainwaves. This research contributes to the understanding of paradoxical insomnia where individuals may not be aware they're asleep, impacting their perception of restfulness.
