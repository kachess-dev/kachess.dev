  Lion’s mane mushroom, maca root, collagen concoctions: there’s a menopause gold rush out on social media’s wild frontier

  A woman gets to a certain age and all she wants is to be left alone. No chance. Writing in the medical journal Post Reproductive Health, a group of academics warned recently of a “[menopause gold rush](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/oct/20/millions-exploited-by-menopause-gold-rush-amid-lack-of-reliable-information-say-experts)” leaving women vulnerable to financial exploitation, misinformation and, frankly, a sweat-inducingly gigantic avalanche of advertising. A lot of this activity has been driven by – guess what? – social media. One respondent told the researchers: “Everything I know about the menopause I learned on Instagram from other women.” As gold rushes go, this has got to be the one you’d least like to see dramatised in a Hollywood movie: “Quick, Bianca, activate the algorithmic analysis of the campaign for the vitamin B6 supplement!”

Academics warn of a "menopause gold rush" on social media, leaving women vulnerable to financial exploitation and misinformation. This rapid expansion of unregulated private companies and individuals is driven by profit, providing menopause information and support. Instead of discussing menopause treatment and management, the conversation has shifted to the commercialisation of menopause. This information overload, largely driven by social media, has led to a situation where some women are learning everything about menopause from platforms like Instagram.
