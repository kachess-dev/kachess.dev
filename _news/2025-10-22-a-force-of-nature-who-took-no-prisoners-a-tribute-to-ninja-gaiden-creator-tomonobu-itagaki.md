  The driving force behind Team Ninja was a game development samurai who almost always won his battles

  Game designer and ex-Team Ninja boss Tomonobu Itagaki died last week aged 58. He was famous for his sunglasses, long black hair, leather jackets – and his penchant for using colourful second world war metaphors to describe game development, marketing strategies and just about anything else. A pugnacious talent, he rocked the boat and made waves in almost every aspect of his life.

  Itagaki joined Japanese game developer Tecmo in 1992, as a young programmer, where he led the creation of the fighting game series Dead or Alive, the first instalment of which was released in 1996. He famously picked a long-running fight with Namco’s Tekken series, after that company’s marketing team ran an ad that he found disparaging. The resulting one-sided beef put his fighting franchise on the world stage in the early 2000s. After Dead or Alive 3, he turned his attentions to [beach volleyball](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/dec/02/dead-or-alive-xtreme-3-otaku-culture-sensitivity-censorship) as a palette cleanser, before starting work on the game that would cement his legacy, a 2004 reinvention of Tecmo’s side-scrolling ninja platformer, Ninja Gaiden.

Game designer and former Team Ninja boss, Tomonobu Itagaki, has passed away at the age of 58. Known for his distinctive style and unconventional metaphors, Itagaki joined Tecmo in 1992, leading the development of the successful fighting game series, Dead or Alive. He later sparked a public rivalry with Namco's Tekken series, which helped his franchise gain global recognition in the early 2000s. After his work on Dead or Alive 3, he transitioned to beach volleyball games before creating Ninja Gaiden in 2004, a game that firmly established his legacy.
