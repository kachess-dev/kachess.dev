Donald Trump has not definitively ruled out the possibility of running for a third term as US president, despite the 22nd amendment stating no person can be elected president more than twice. The 79-year-old, while on a trip to Asia, expressed a desire to run again, citing his "best numbers ever". The possibility of Trump's allies challenging the amendment or finding a loophole is also present. However, Trump has ruled out running for Vice President.
