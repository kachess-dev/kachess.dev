  Now, after volunteering in an experiment to count how many such substances people are subjected to, Wesselius and his wife are one step closer to understanding the consequences of living among chemical-sprayed fields of seed potato, sugar beet, wheat, rye and onion.

A study in the Netherlands used silicone wristbands to capture and identify substances people are exposed to in their environment. Volunteer Khoji Wesselius, who lives in a farming village, took part in the experiment, which detected 173 different substances in one week. This brings him and his wife closer to understanding the potential impacts of living near fields sprayed with chemicals for crops like seed potato, sugar beet, wheat, rye, and onion. The experiment highlights the challenge of avoiding pesticide exposure in certain environments.
