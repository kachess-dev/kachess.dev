The consequences of Donald Trump’s decision to scrap USAID, and other countries’ decisions to reduce funding, are playing out in deadly fashion

Malaria is a pandemic disease that hits the voiceless hardest: most of those who fall ill and die are small children and pregnant women in Africa. It is the leading infectious killer of the continent, responsible for [nearly](https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2024) 600,000 deaths a year. Cases are rising and there is an urgent need for more funding, yet western donor countries are instead cutting back on aid. We still hear brave talk about eliminating malaria. But an expert [report](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/21/global-health-infectious-disease-aid-cuts-malaria-funding-cost-deaths-gdp-africa) now warns of a potential resurgence that could add almost a million more deaths to the annual toll by the end of the decade.

Most of the money to fight the mosquito-borne disease – 59% – comes through the Global Fund to Fight&nbsp;Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Its executive director, Peter Sands, [said](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/malaria-resurgence-could-kill-nearly-one-million-by-2030-as-funding-cuts-hit/) last week at the World Health Summit in Berlin that of the three killers, the&nbsp;one that kept him awake at night was malaria.
