  The consequences of Donald Trump’s decision to scrap USAID, and other countries’ decisions to reduce funding, are playing out in deadly fashion

  Malaria is a pandemic disease that hits the voiceless hardest: most of those who fall ill and die are small children and pregnant women in Africa. It is the leading infectious killer of the continent, responsible for [nearly](https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/reports/world-malaria-report-2024) 600,000 deaths a year. Cases are rising and there is an urgent need for more funding, yet western donor countries are instead cutting back on aid. We still hear brave talk about eliminating malaria. But an expert [report](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/oct/21/global-health-infectious-disease-aid-cuts-malaria-funding-cost-deaths-gdp-africa) now warns of a potential resurgence that could add almost a million more deaths to the annual toll by the end of the decade.

  Most of the money to fight the mosquito-borne disease – 59% – comes through the Global Fund to Fight&nbsp;Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Its executive director, Peter Sands, [said](https://healthpolicy-watch.news/malaria-resurgence-could-kill-nearly-one-million-by-2030-as-funding-cuts-hit/) last week at the World Health Summit in Berlin that of the three killers, the&nbsp;one that kept him awake at night was malaria.

The scrapping of USAID by Donald Trump and aid reduction from other countries could cause a deadly resurgence of malaria, warns an expert report. Malaria, primarily affecting children and pregnant women in Africa, causes nearly 600,000 deaths annually and cases are on the rise. Despite urgent need for increased funding, Western countries are cutting aid. The Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which provides 59% of funding to combat malaria, could see a potential increase of nearly a million deaths by the decade's end due to these cuts.
