The article explores the dilemma of deciding whether to step back from a difficult relationship or stick it out. Therapist KC Davis suggests that this decision can be guided by certain questions. If a loved one's behavior is bothersome, individuals should assess their feelings, the impact of the relationship on their well-being, the loved one's willingness to change, and the possibility of acceptance if change doesn't occur. The decision ultimately depends on personal values, emotional resources, and the specific context of the relationship.
