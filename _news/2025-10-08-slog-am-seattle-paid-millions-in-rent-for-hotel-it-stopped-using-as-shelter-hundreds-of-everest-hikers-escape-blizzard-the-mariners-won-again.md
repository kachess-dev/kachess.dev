original_content: "The Stranger's morning news roundup. by Nathalie Graham\n\n**The
  Weather:&nbsp;** It'll be cloudy and cooler for the most part with highs only reaching
  60 degrees. No rain yet. Trust, it is coming.&nbsp;\n\n**Signature Stealers:&nbsp;**
  Hedgefund manager Brian Heywood's political group Let's Go Washington is running
  into a few snags while signature gathering for their anti-trans, anti-LGBTQ initiative
  including a re-do of the misleadingly-named Parents Bill of Rights which would give
  parents access to student health records and give them undue influence. There's
  also an anti-trans sports initiative, too. While on the signature-gathering job,
  people have been behaving badly. [According to KUOW](https://www.kuow.org/stories/interfering-with-signature-gathering-for-wa-initiatives-is-on-the-rise-it-s-also-illegal),
  there have been 31 incidents damaging, stealing, or destroying Let's Go Washington
  initiative signatures. Someone straight up stole two decks of signatures in Covington,
  and, as KUOW reports, \"in Federal Way, someone drove by in a car and threw 'red
  liquid' on signature pages, and in Yakima, a man told a signature-gatherer he was
  going home to grab a gun.\" This is illegal and undemocratic. The initiative process
  as means of referendum to go against the will of the voters and prey on misinformation
  is not.&nbsp;\n\n**Transit Fan Bruce Harrell Killed Another Transportation Project:&nbsp;**
  Remember last week's big to-do over the Capitol Hill bus-only lane the mayor's office
  killed because businesses complained? The bus lane was saved due to public outcry,
  but that's not the only project Mayor Bruce Harrell has allegedly laid waste to,
  [according to The _Urbanist_.](https://www.theurbanist.org/2025/10/07/lake-washington-boulevard-safety-upgrades-fully-designed-before-mayor-pulled-plug/)
  A planned and in-progress Lake Washington Boulevard intersection redesign, which
  was improve pedestrian crossings and redirect traffic, was quietly killed and removed
  from plans. The intersection in question is mere blocks away from Harrell's Seward
  Park home.&nbsp;\n\n**Bruce Hates Big Money in Politics:** In a fundraising email
  yesterday evening, Bruce Harrell called on donors to help him because a PAC backing
  his opponent Katie Wilson “dropped another $75,000 into the race, bringing their
  total to nearly $200,000.” This is rich—emphasis on rich—coming from Harrell whose
  own PAC has raised over $1 million with upwards of $770,000 coming in the last two
  months. Pot? Meet kettle.\n\n**You Gotta Love These Guys:** Hey, the Mariners beat
  those dreaded Detroit Tigers in a decisive 8-4 victory Tuesday after a hours-long
  rain delay. Personally, I think not having a roofed stadium in 2025 should result
  in an auto-loss for the host team. You live in Detroit. Weather happens there. Diatribe
  aside, the Ms looked good (so long as you scrub closer Caleb Ferguson's bottom-of-the-ninth
  appearance). The whole city is abuzz with it. I like it.\n\n**If they win another
  game** , the Mariners move onto the American League Championship Series. They haven't
  been there since October 2001 when they faced off against the Yankees and the whole
  country rooted against the Mariners because, well, y'know. 9/11.&nbsp;\n\n**Dump
  Here:&nbsp;** In a moment of serendipitous synchronicity, Cal Raleigh whacked his
  61st home run of the season (though, I was informed last night the post-season stats&nbsp;_don't
  count_) into the opposite field stands. Who caught it? The only guy in Mariners
  gear. Not only that, he was wearing a \"DUMP 61 HERE\" shirt. And Raleigh did. The
  cameras panned away and then panned back in time to catch the guy peeling of the
  61 shirt to reveal&nbsp;_another_ shirt that read \"DUMP 62 HERE.\" He knows something.&nbsp;\n\n>
  He is now wearing a Dump Here 62 shirt.  \n>   \n> [[image or embed]](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:rafuudgy4wrxvb4h4bsqox4t/post/3m2nja7mmlm2e?ref_src=embed)\n>

  Rooms at the Inn, Actually:** During the pandemic, Seattle successfully housed homeless
  people in vacant hotels. The 53-room Civic Hotel was one of these properties. After
  housing people for years, the city signed a $2.7 million lease extension in 2024
  to keep operating the space through the year. As people moved out for permanent
  housing, their rooms went unfilled. Seattleites paid around $4,200 per empty room
  per month, according to a collaboration between [KUOW and ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/article/seattle-homeless-shelter-vacancies-civic-hotel).
  The city blamed the vacancies on budget deficits and a loss of COVID-era government
  funds. Meanwhile, shelter bed shortages continued to be an issue for Seattle's growing
  homeless population. The whole drama contradicts the Harrell administration's emphasis
  on tracking shelter capacity better, transparency, and doing away with government
  waste.&nbsp;\n\n**Is Climbing Mount Everest Even Cool Anymore?** A snowstorm in
  the Himalayas [stranded](https://apnews.com/article/china-everest-tibet-stranded-hikers-rescued-13f5b70ae432eae84cd38938837b5de5)
  900 hikers, guides, and staff on Mount Everest. Um, 900 people? Seems like too many.
  This is why that poor mountain is covered in [shit](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68237123)
  and [cadavers](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/more-than-200-dead-bodies-have-been-left-behind-on-mount-everest-and-many-mark-the-path-to-the-summit-146904416/).
  Anyway, they've all descended safely by now and the mountain is closed while the
  storm rages on. Hopefully all these people can take time to find another hobby.
  Maybe they should read [my column](https://www.thestranger.com/collections/78905430/play-date).&nbsp;\n\n**National
  Guard Comes to Chicago:&nbsp;** Around 500 deployed National Guardsmen from Texas
  and Illinois [are expected](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/10/08/us/trump-national-guard-chicago-illinois)
  to enter the Chicago area today despite outrage from local and state leaders. The
  plan is for the troops to protect immigration officers and detention centers. On
  Wednesday, ahead of the troop invasion, Trump&nbsp;[called for the arrest](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/10/08/trump-chicago-national-guard-ice-jb-pritzker/86575398007/)
  of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker. \"Chicago Mayor
  should be in jail for failing to protect Ice Officers! Governor Pritzker also!\"
  he penned on Truth Social.&nbsp;\n\n**Freedom of Speech Abounds:** Jimmy Kimmel
  will not go gentle into that good light. After being resurrected by the television
  gods, Kimmel aired this wild little clip as part of a [segment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iy5o38VRjtE&themeRefresh=1)
  on Trump's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and claims he never sent Epstein that
  freaky birthday card.&nbsp;\n\n> Holy crap. Trump will make the FCC crucify Jimmy
  Kimmel for this.  \n>   \n> [[image or embed]](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ekts44pfepbmryv2h633onqu/post/3m2nqv6qj3s25?ref_src=embed)\n>

  Is This Good Governance?** Republican Florida state Rep. Kevin Steele [filed legislation](https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5544681-florida-republican-charlie-kirk-state-colleges/)
  that would pull state funding from public universities if they refuse to rename
  certain streets around their campus after slain podcaster Charlie Kirk. If it's
  passed, the bill will go into effect immediately and colleges will have 90 days
  to comply.&nbsp;\n\n**The War on Education:&nbsp;** If it seems like this administration
  really hates public education, that's because it does. The Department of Education
  under Trump is interested primarily in dismantling public schools and standing up
  an education diet of homeschool, virtual school, and religious schools. [Read the
  full ProPublica story on this here.&nbsp;](https://www.propublica.org/article/education-department-public-schools-activists-linda-mcmahon-trump?utm_source=bluesky&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=propublica-bsky&utm_content=cm)\n\n**Maybe&nbsp;_This&nbsp;_I****
  s Good Governance?&nbsp;**If Trump's attacks on renewable energy, his undermining
  of climate science, and repeals of climate policy are surprising, just remember
  the Trump administration [is full](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/08/trump-administration-fossil-fuels-climate)
  of people affiliated with fossil fuels including at least 40 people who have directly
  worked within the oil, gas, or coal industries.\n\n**Comey in Court:&nbsp;** Former
  FBI director James Comey [pleaded not guilty](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cly14kplv02t)
  to charges that he made false statements to Congress and obstructed justice. The
  charges were brought by the Department of Justice. Comey's trial will begin on Jan.
  5. Ah, Insurrection Eve.&nbsp;\n\n**Dinosaur Snatched, Returned:&nbsp;** Last week,
  a burglar [nabbed](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/stolen-california-gas-station-dinosaur-returned-apology-note-rcna236041)
  the dinosaur mascot known as Claire from in front of the Brentwood Sinclair gas
  station in Los Angeles. Outrage followed. Scoldy Jamie Lee Curtis got extra sanctimonious
  about it online. On Monday, the thief returned Claire. She was wrapped in a cloth
  with a note attached that read, \"I’m sorry for stealing. Please don’t charge me!\"\n\n**A
