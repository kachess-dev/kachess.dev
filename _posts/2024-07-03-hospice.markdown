This week, I made the difficult decision to enroll my father in hospice care. He is suffering from primary progressive aphasia and is in the very late stages of the disease. For the past two months, he has been struggling with hallucinations and paranoia, making him miserable. He believes the staff around him are carrying weapons and have beaten him, which has increased his agitation and caused him to move around at all hours. A few weeks ago, despite round-the-clock care, he fell from his bed, hit his head, and suffered a brain bleed. He has been in the hospital since.

Due to being bedridden for so long, he can no longer stand or walk. While this sounds terrible, standing and walking only contributed to injuries because his balance was so poor. Frankly, this might be better for everyone at this point. He never wanted to be bedridden and hallucinating. This wasn't supposed to progress this far. The problem with a brain failing in an otherwise healthy body is that our medical system and society don't know how to handle it. 

So, we have shifted to comfort care, which allows him to return to his assisted living facility and eliminates further trips to the emergency room, of which he's had many in the last few months. 

Allan is still very strong and not emaciated, which concerned the hospice doctors because it is not what they normally see.

The next weeks and months will be difficult. At this point, we're waiting for some condition to catch up with him, causing him to lose his ability to care for himself and eventually pass away. If we hadn't given him IV fluids and antibiotics during this most recent hospital visit, he would likely have already passed. I fear that might have been the better outcome at this point.

Both he and I hope, in his moments of clarity, that he goes to sleep and doesn't wake up. Unfortunately, he is no longer capable of making the decision to end his life under our state's death with dignity laws. So, we wait.
