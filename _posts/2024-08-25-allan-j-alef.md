Allan Jay Alef, 74, of Bellevue, WA, passed away on August 25, 2024, after years of battling the effects of primary progressive aphasia. Born on June 17, 1950, in Princeton, NJ, Allan was the beloved son of Gustave and Joan Alef.

Allan graduated from South Eugene High School in 1968 and earned his degree from the University of Oregon in 1972, followed by a master's degree. He was proud of his participation in Junior ROTC and ROTC throughout his schooling. His early career included ten honorable years in the Army as a military police officer at Fort Hood, where he served with distinction. After leaving the Army, he dedicated his professional life as a Special Agent in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, from which he retired in 2002.

Allan was an avid photographer, capturing the beauty of the world around him. He loved walking his dogs and was keenly interested in investing, staying engaged with the markets, and enjoying their challenges.

To those who knew him, Allan was the most loyal person one could meet. His steadfastness and reliability were hallmarks of his character.

Allan is survived by his son, Chris Alef, and daughter-in-law, Corinne Alef; his grandchildren, Clay Alef and Graeme Alef; his brothers, Peter Alef and Eric Alef; his sister-in-law, Carol Alef; and his trusted friend, Barb Hammermeister. He was predeceased by his ex-wife, Gail Alef. Allan's family and friends will always cherish the memories they shared with him.

Following Allan's wishes, no formal funeral or memorial service will be held. Instead of donations or flowers, please honor Allan by taking yourself out to a nice meal and making a toast in his memory.

Rest in peace, Allan. Your loyalty, kindness, and spirit will forever remain in our hearts.
